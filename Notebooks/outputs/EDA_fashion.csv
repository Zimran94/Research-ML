akira_article_1005_Why_Linen_Tops_Are_a_Must-Have_for_Ladies_in_Sri_Lankas_Trop.pdf,"Why Linen Tops Are a Must-Have for Ladies in Sri Lanka’s Tropical Weather?
Linen tops have become an essential wardrobe staple for women in Sri Lanka, thanks to
their lightweight and breathable nature. Given Sri Lanka’s tropical climate, which is
characterized by high humidity and warm temperatures, linen is one of the best fabric
choices for staying cool and stylish. This article explores the many reasons why linen
tops for ladies in Sri Lanka are a must-have, highlighting their benefits, styling tips,
and why they stand out as the perfect blend of comfort and elegance. Linen is a natural
fiber derived from the flax plant, making it incredibly breathable. It allows air to
circulate around the body, helping to wick away moisture and keep you feeling fresh
throughout the day. In a hot and humid country like Sri Lanka, this is crucial for
maintaining comfort, whether you’re at work, running errands, or attending a casual
gathering. One of the best properties of linen is its ability to absorb moisture while
drying quickly. This makes linen tops ideal for daily wear in Sri Lanka’s humid
conditions, as they help to prevent excessive sweating and discomfort. Linen tops are
lightweight, making them a preferred choice for everyday fashion. They don’t cling to the
body, allowing for better airflow. Unlike synthetic fabrics, which can feel suffocating,
linen provides a natural and relaxed feel. Linen tops come in a variety of styles, from
casual button-down shirts to elegant blouses and trendy tunics. Whether you prefer a
relaxed fit or a more structured look, there are plenty of options available to suit
different fashion preferences. Despite being lightweight, linen tops can be layered
effortlessly. Pair a linen blouse with a camisole underneath for a chic, layered look. For
cooler days or air-conditioned environments, throwing on a lightweight scarf or a cotton
cardigan can complement the outfit beautifully. Sustainability is an important factor when
choosing clothing, and linen is one of the most environmentally friendly fabrics
available. Linen production requires less water and fewer chemicals compared to cotton,
making it a great choice for eco-conscious consumers. Although linen is known for its
tendency to wrinkle, this adds to its charm, giving it a relaxed, effortless look.
Moreover, linen tops are easy to care for; they can be hand-washed or machine-washed and
typically become softer with each wash. For Sri Lankan women looking to combine comfort
with style, linen tops are an excellent choice. Their breathability, moisture-wicking
properties, and versatile designs make them a must-have in any wardrobe. Whether you’re
heading to the office, going out for lunch, or simply relaxing at home, linen tops ensure
that you stay cool and stylish all day long. Discover a beautiful collection of stylish
and high-quality linen tops for ladies in Sri Lanka at Akira.lk . Elevate your wardrobe

Living in a tropical country like Sri Lanka means sunshine, humidity, and occasional rain

comfort in this weather. Go for cotton, linen, or rayon instead of synthetic fabrics.

stripes with batik prints—two designs that would normally clash but, with the right
balance, create an eye-catching look that showcases your individuality. When mixing
patterns, try to keep the colors in a complementary palette. For example, pairing earthy
batik prints with subtle striped accents creates a cohesive yet unique style that’s all
your own. Blending patterns adds dimension and personality to any outfit, letting you move
beyond conventional styling. White has traditionally been seen as a warm-weather color,
but this year, it’s taking on a year-round appeal. A crisp white linen dress isn’t just
for summer; it’s a versatile staple that looks fabulous in any season. In cooler months,
layer your linen dress with cozy knits, a sleek jacket, or textured accessories for a
stylish, weather-appropriate look. Linen, often thought of as a “summer fabric,” is
actually incredibly versatile and comfortable all year long. Paired with the right
accessories, white linen pieces can seamlessly transition from season to season, bringing
a fresh, clean aesthetic to your wardrobe every month of the year. Gone are the days when
style meant discomfort. Fashion in 2025 emphasizes the importance of comfort without

handloom linen is at the forefront of this movement. Known for its breathability,
durability, and eco-friendly qualities, linen is rapidly gaining popularity among fashion
enthusiasts. Linen dresses and linen frocks are becoming essential wardrobe staples for

combines the artistry of traditional batik with the comfort and sustainability of linen.
This fusion not only preserves cultural heritage but also promotes responsible fashion
practices. The versatility of linen makes it suitable for various occasions. A simple
linen dress can be styled for a casual day out, while an elegant linen frock can be

and cultural pride. With each region offering its unique draping style, the saree can be
transformed to reflect various histories, lifestyles, and social nuances. Here’s a look at
some of Sri Lanka’s diverse draping styles that showcase the beauty and versatility of
this timeless attire. The Kandyan style, or Osariya, is one of the most well-known and
widely worn styles in Sri Lanka, especially among Sinhalese women. It involves wrapping
the saree with pleats at the side, and the fall is tucked at the back, creating a fishtail
effect. A separate jacket and frill add elegance to this style, making it perfect for
weddings, celebrations, and formal occasions. The Osariya reflects the grace and poise of
Kandyan culture, adding a regal charm to the wearer. While not native to Sri Lanka, the
Indian Nivi drape has gained popularity due to its simplicity and adaptability. In this
style, pleats are made in the front, and the pallu (the decorative end of the saree) is
draped over the shoulder. This versatile style is ideal for both everyday wear and formal
events, allowing easy movement and a flattering silhouette. Predominantly worn by Tamil
women, the Madisar drape is traditional in Tamil weddings and ceremonies. This style
involves wrapping the saree in a way that resembles a pair of trousers, symbolizing
strength and commitment in marriage. The Madisar’s unique drape requires a longer saree
and a special technique, making it a true celebration of Tamil heritage. In modern Sri
Lankan fashion , fusion drapes are increasingly popular, blending traditional elements
with contemporary styles. Experimenting with belted pallu, asymmetrical drapes, or pairing

confident and comfortable in your batik attire. Here’s how to choose the perfect batik
designer dress for your shape: For those with an hourglass shape, dresses that emphasize
the waistline and hug the curves work wonders. Wrap dresses or belted batik designs help
highlight your waist, while A-line silhouettes provide an elegant balance. A batik dress
with bold prints can bring even more focus to your shape, enhancing your natural curves.
If you’re pear-shaped with a smaller upper body and fuller hips, consider batik dresses
with intricate designs or bright colors on the top half to draw the eye upward. Flared
skirts and empire waists also create a balanced look. Choosing patterns that emphasize the
neckline or shoulders will add definition and highlight your proportions beautifully.
Apple-shaped bodies look fabulous in dresses with a relaxed fit and flowy fabrics. A-line
or shift dresses in batik prints create a streamlined look, while designs with minimal
detail around the midsection can enhance comfort and style. Look for dresses with a V-neck
or an asymmetrical hem to elongate the torso and create a flattering silhouette. If your
body has a rectangular shape, try batik dresse s that create the illusion of curves.
Dresses with ruffles, pleats, or draped details add volume and femininity. A belted batik
dress or one with a cinched waist can also give definition and contour to your figure. For
a petite frame, shorter hemlines and smaller batik patterns are ideal for creating a
lengthened look. Mini or knee-length batik dresses with vertical patterns can add height

benefits suited to various styles and climates. Here’s a quick comparison to help you
decide which fabric suits your lifestyle, comfort, and wardrobe needs best. Both linen and
cotton are known for their breathability, making them ideal for warm weather. However,
linen, made from the flax plant, is particularly well-suited for tropical climates as it
naturally wicks away moisture and dries quickly. Cotton, being softer and more versatile,
provides everyday comfort and is gentle on sensitive skin. Best Choice: For hot, humid
weather or beachwear, linen’s cooling properties make it ideal. For all-day comfort,
cotton’s softness is hard to beat. Linen is one of the strongest natural fibers, and its
durability only improves with washing. It’s designed to last through years of wear without
losing its texture . Cotton is also durable but less resistant to wear over time,
especially if it’s lightweight or untreated. Best Choice: If you’re looking for longevity,
especially in staple pieces, linen is a fantastic choice for its resilience. Linen is
known for its slightly textured, rustic look and often sports a natural wrinkle, which
adds character to any outfit . Cotton, in contrast, can look crisper and is available in
various finishes, from polished and formal to casual and cozy. Best Choice: If you prefer
a refined, relaxed look, linen is ideal for casual and semi-formal wear . For versatility
and polish, cotton fits almost any style. Linen is easy to care for and often looks best
with minimal ironing. Cotton, while easy to maintain, may require a bit more attention to

White clothing holds deep symbolic meaning in Sri Lankan culture. From religious rituals

respect. These values are deeply rooted in both Buddhist and Hindu traditions practiced
across the island. In Buddhist culture, white is commonly worn during visits to temples or
religious observances such as Poya days. It reflects a person’s inner clarity and
sincerity in devotion. Wearing white to such events is not just a custom; it’s a quiet
gesture of spiritual reverence. Similarly, in Hindu religious ceremonies, white is often
used to denote sanctity and spiritual readiness. White dresses are also a key element in
school uniforms in Sri Lanka, particularly for girls. The dress symbolizes equality and
discipline, values held dear in the educational system. In marriage ceremonies, white
dresses or sarees are chosen to represent the purity and auspiciousness of the bride’s new

difference in comfort. Linen , made from the fibers of the flax plant, is widely
considered the best fabric for tropical climates—and for good reason. One of linen’s
standout features is its breathability. The fabric allows for ample airflow, keeping your
body cool even during the hottest months. It also wicks moisture away from the skin,
preventing stickiness and discomfort. Because it is naturally antibacterial, linen resists
odor and remains fresh for longer. Another reason for its popularity is its lightweight
feel. Linen garments are easy to wear and don’t cling to the body. The texture is soft but
structured, giving it a casual elegance that suits both relaxed and formal settings.
Whether it’s a flowy linen frock for a beachside dinner or a simple blouse for everyday
wear, linen helps you stay stylish while beating the heat. For anyone living in or
visiting tropical climates, linen is a smart, stylish choice that balances comfort with
sophistication. To explore high-quality linen clothing that suits Sri Lanka’s weather,

perfect fabric to beat the summer heat while looking chic. Whether you prefer a classic

Made from flax plants, linen requires less water and fewer chemicals to produce compared

supports a greener planet. A lightweight linen dress paired with flat sandals and a straw
hat creates the perfect laid-back summer look. Whether you’re heading to the beach or
exploring the city, this outfit keeps you comfortable and stylish. For a polished office

akira_page_28_article_14_The_Evolution_of_Batik_Patterns_Through_Time.pdf,"The Evolution of Batik Patterns Through Time
Batik, a traditional fabric art form renowned for its intricate patterns and vibrant
colors, has evolved significantly over the centuries. From its ancient origins to
contemporary fashion, batik patterns have undergone a remarkable transformation,
reflecting changes in cultural, social, and artistic trends. Here’s a journey through the
evolution of batik patterns and how they continue to shape and influence modern design.
Batik’s origins can be traced back to ancient Indonesia, where it was initially used for
ceremonial and ritualistic purposes. The earliest batik patterns were deeply symbolic,
often depicting motifs related to nature, spirituality, and social status. Designs such as
floral patterns, geometric shapes, and s ymbolic imagery were created using traditional
resist-dye techniques, which involved applying hot wax to fabric to create intricate
designs. During the Javanese period, batik patterns became more sophisticated and refined.
The art form was highly developed in Java, with distinct regional styles emerging. For
instance, the “Parang” motif symbolized strength and was reserved for royalty, while
“Kawung” patterns, inspired by the shape of palm flowers, were used for everyday wear.
These classic motifs became iconic representations of Javanese culture and batik
craftsmanship . The arrival of European colonizers in Southeast Asia introduced new
influences to batik design . Colonial-era batik often combined traditional Indonesian
patterns with European artistic elements, leading to a fusion of styles. This period saw
the introduction of new colors, patterns, and techniques, resulting in unique hybrid
designs that reflected the cross-cultural exchanges of the time. As batik moved into the
20th century, it began to adapt to changing fashion trends and technological advancements.
Modern batik artists and designers started experimenting with new materials, dyes, and
techniques, leading to a broader range of patterns and styles. Contemporary batik patterns
often incorporate abstract designs, geometric shapes, and bold color combinations,
reflecting the influence of modern art and design movements. With the globalization of
fashion, batik has found its way onto international runways and into global fashion
markets. Designers from around the world have embraced batik’s unique aesthetic,
integrating it into high fashion collections and everyday wear. This global exposure has
led to the evolution of batik patterns, blending traditional motifs with contemporary
influences to create fresh, innovative designs. In the digital age, batik has continued to
evolve with the advent of new technologies. Digital printing and advanced textile
techniques have allowed for greater precision and creativity in batik design. Artists and
designers can now experiment with intricate patterns, vibrant colors, and unconventional
materials , pushing the boundaries of traditional batik and expanding its possibilities.
Looking forward, the future of batik patterns lies in balancing the preservation of
traditional techniques with the embrace of modern innovation. As designers continue to
explore new possibilities and interpretations, batik remains a dynamic and evolving art
form. The ongoing evolution of batik patterns ensures that this rich cultural heritage
continues to inspire and captivate new generations. Batik’s journey from ancient craft to
contemporary fashion is a testament to its enduring appeal and adaptability. By exploring
the evolution of batik patterns , we gain a deeper appreciation for this timeless art form
and its impact on global fashion.",3645

accessory, such as a scarf, bag, or pair of shoes, can be an easy way to introduce more
color without overwhelming your look. As you become more comfortable, you can start

Handloom fabrics are cherished for their craftsmanship, beauty, and cultural significance.
To ensure their longevity and maintain their stunning appearance, it’s essential to care
for them properly. Whether you’re new to handloom textiles or looking to refine your care
routine, this guide provides you with everything you need to keep your handloom pieces in
pristine condition. Handloom fabrics are delicate and should be washed with care. Always
opt for hand washing using cold water and a mild detergent. Avoid wringing or twisting the
fabric; instead, gently press out excess water and lay it flat to dry. If machine washing
is necessary, use a gentle cycle and place the fabric in a mesh laundry bag . Store
handloom fabrics in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight to prevent fading. It’s
best to fold them neatly and place them in a cotton or muslin bag to protect against dust
and insects. For heavier fabrics like handloom silk, avoid hanging them for long periods
as this can cause stretching. Ironing handloom fabrics requires attention to detail.
Always use a low-heat setting and iron on the reverse side to protect the fabric’s
surface. For added protection, place a thin cotton cloth between the iron and the fabric.
If you’re unsure, steaming is a safer alternative for removing wrinkles. In the event of a
stain, act quickly. Blot the area with a clean, damp cloth—never rub, as this can spread
the stain. For tougher stains, a mixture of water and white vinegar can be effective, but
always test on a small, inconspicuous area first. To keep your handloom fabrics fresh,
it’s a good idea to air them out occasionally. Simply hang them in a shaded area with good
airflow to prevent any mustiness from developing over time. By following these simple care
and maintenance tips, you can ensure that your handloom pieces remain as beautiful and
vibrant as the day you bought them. At Akira, we are passionate",1989

thoughtful, informed shopping. Here are some expert tips to help you shop smart and find
garments that offer both style and longevity. One of the key indicators of a high-quality
piece is the fabric. Natural fibers like cotton, silk, wool, and linen are not only
durable but also breathable and comfortable. Feel the fabric to ensure it is substantial
and smooth, without any rough or flimsy spots. Examine the garment’s construction. High-
quality pieces will have neat, even stitching with no loose threads or gaps. Reinforced
seams and securely attached embellishments are signs of meticulous craftsmanship. Invest
in classic designs that won’t go out of style. Timeless pieces like a well-tailored
blazer, a little black dress, or a versatile batik saree serve as the foundation of a
sophisticated wardrobe. A garment that fits well and feels comfortable is more likely to
be worn frequently. Ensure the clothing doesn’t restrict your movement and fits properly
to enhance both the look and longevity of the piece. High-quality clothing often features
thoughtful details like well-placed darts, secure buttons, and quality zippers. These
details are signs of meticulous craftsmanship and significantly impact the piece’s overall
quality and lifespan. Research brands with a reputation for quality and ethical production
practices. At Akira, we pride ourselves on our dedication to craftsmanship and sustainable
fashion, ensuring you receive the best in both style and substance. Choose pieces that can
be mixed and matched with various items in your wardrobe. A handloom kurta, for example,

are difficult to ascertain, it is widely accepted that the batik-making techniques were
first refined in Indonesia, particularly on the island of Java. Historical records suggest
that batik was being crafted as early as the 4th century BC. The creation of batik is a
meticulous and labor-intensive process involving the application of wax-resistant dye to
fabric. The traditional method, known as “batik tulis,” entails drawing intricate designs
with a canting, a small tool that dispenses hot wax. This wax serves as a resist,
preventing the dye from penetrating certain areas of the fabric. The process is repeated
multiple times with different colors to produce complex, multi-layered designs. Batik
holds immense cultural significance in many countries, particularly in Indonesia,
Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and parts of Africa. Each region boasts unique styles, motifs, and
symbolic meanings associated with batik patterns. In Indonesia, batik transcends mere
fabric, embodying cultural identity and national pride. In 2009, UNESCO recognized
Indonesian batik as a Masterpiece of Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Traditional
Javanese batik patterns often carry symbolic meanings, with specific designs reserved for
royalty and special occasions. For instance, the “Parang” motif symbolizes strength and
resilience, while the “Kawung” pattern represents wisdom and justice. In Africa, batik has
a storied history and is an integral part of traditional attire in several countries,
including Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal. African batik is renowned for its bold and vibrant
designs, often featuring symbolic and spiritual motifs. The fabrics are utilized for
various purposes, including clothing, ceremonial garments, and home decor. Introduced
during the Dutch colonial era, Sri Lankan batik has developed its unique style, merging
traditional and contemporary elements. Known for its bold and vibrant designs, Sri Lankan
batik often depicts scenes from nature and religious motifs. The town of Matale is
particularly renowned for its batik artisans, who continue to innovate while preserving
the traditional techniques. In Sri Lanka, batik is more than just a fabric; it’s an
embodiment of the island’s rich cultural heritage. The meticulous craftsmanship and
vibrant colors of Sri Lankan batik reflect the country’s artistic traditions and natural
beauty. Each piece Modern Influence and Global Appeal Batik has transcended its
traditional roots, garnering popularity and recognition on the global stage. Contemporary
fashion designers and artists have embraced batik, incorporating its patterns and
techniques into modern clothing, accessories, and art. This fusion of traditional and
modern elements has helped preserve and promote batik as a living art form. Embrace the

In the realm of fashion, sustainability is no longer a mere trend but a vital commitment.
Handloom textiles stand out as a beacon of eco-friendly fashion, offering a greener
alternative to conventional manufacturing methods. At Akira, we proudly embrace the
sustainability of handloom fabrics, and here’s why they are a standout choice for the eco-
conscious consumer: Handloom textiles are crafted using traditional methods that
significantly reduce environmental impact. Unlike industrial fabric production, which
relies heavily on machinery and chemical dyes, handloom weaving utilizes minimal energy
and predominantly natural dyes. This process not only conserves resources but also ensures
that each piece is crafted with care and respect for the environment. Choosing handloom
fabrics means supporting skilled artisans and preserving age-old techniques. Each
handwoven garment Handloom textiles often use natural fibers such as cotton, silk, and
wool, which are biodegradable and have a lower environmental footprint compared to
synthetic alternatives. These materials decompose naturally, reducing waste and promoting
a more sustainable lifecycle for your clothing. Industrial textile production is notorious
for its excessive water usage. Handloom weaving, on the other hand, is far more water-
efficient. The dyeing process in handloom textiles typically uses less water, and many
artisans employ natural dyes that are less harmful to aquatic ecosystems. Handloom fabrics
are renowned for their exceptional quality and durability. Investing in high-quality,
timeless pieces means you are less likely to engage in fast fashion cycles. Instead, you
enjoy long-lasting garments that stand the test of time, both in style and sustainability.
Many handloom producers follow fair trade practices, ensuring that artisans are paid
fairly and work in safe conditions. By supporting handloom textiles, you align with
ethical fashion principles that prioritize fair labor practices and social responsibility.

Mar 27 2025. Today we are showing some love to a few of our very own local clothing
brands. Here are my top 4 great, yet lesser-known clothing brands in Sri Lanka that I came
across over the past couple of years. These emerging brands aren’t just making clothes;
they ‘re telling stories and empowering themselves and our communities. Every piece you
choose from one of these brands is more than just an outfit. It’s a piece of Sri Lanka,
crafted with love and care. If you’re looking to refresh your wardrobe with some chic and
cute pieces without breaking the bank, Flamingo SL is the place to be! I have shopped at
Flamingo SL many times and they never disappoint. This Sri Lankan brand offers a fantastic
selection of trendy clothes that are perfect for any occasion. What makes Flamingo SL even
more special is their commitment to supporting local design and businesses. They opened
their first store last year and it is a testament to this commitment as there are many
other local brands at the store. So while you shop for clothes at Flamingo SL you can also
shop for accessories under one roof. Their tops start from LKR 2000, dresses and trousers
from LKR 4000, and skirts from LKR 2500. Check out their full range of clothes in-store or
online. I absolutely love Absolute Basics! Let me tell you why I love this Sri Lankan
clothing brand. Sometimes all I want is to wear really comfortable clothes and look nice
in them. I always pick my absolute basics tops and pants to do the job. They are made of
high-quality, lightweight, and breathable fabrics and I absolutely love them. AB clothes
are perfect for Sri Lanka’s tropical climate because it keeps you cool and comfortable all
day long. They offer comfortable and stylish pieces that are perfect for both casual
outings and formal office settings. Another big plus is that the prices are very
reasonable for the quality you’re getting. Tops and t-shirts start from LKR 2500, dresses

the best way to know if you’ll love it is to try it out for yourself. Their flagship store
is down Galle Road in Colpetty and they also have a store in One Galle Face Mall. You can
always check out their online store too. I found Maia two years ago when I stumbled upon
their Christmas collection. It was so beautiful and elegant but had sold out by the time I
wanted to order. Since then, I have ordered from Maia from time to time and it quickly
became a favourite of mine for several reasons. Maia clothes have that classic look that
never goes out of style, but they also have a modern twist that makes them feel elegant
and current. Maia prices are so reasonable, so it’s easy to justify investing in pieces
that I’ll love for years to come. Their dresses are priced from LKR 5000 upwards. Maia is
definitely worth checking out. It’s a brand that truly embodies the spirit of Sri Lankan

life_article_From_Heritage_to_Streetwear_Common_Folk_weaving_a_modern_tal.pdf,"From Heritage to Streetwear: Common Folk weaving a modern tale of innovation
Feb 16 2024. Handloom textile weaving in Sri Lanka is said to date back to the 6th century
BC as early as when Prince Vijaya from India landed in Sri Lanka and first saw Kuveni, a
queen of an indigenous race of Yakshas (demon tribe) spinning yarn at the wheel. Fast
forward to the 21st century, the traditional art and craft is still alive, surviving
industrialization, a brutal civil war and even the recent crisis. Teaming up and pursuing
the art with innovation, is a lawyer and a designer Sharendra Peiris and Thamali
Dharmawardena, co-founders of the handloom textile R&D and innovation brand “Common Folk”.
Since its inception in 2017, their main focus (motto) has been directed towards “uplifting
heritage crafts with technology.” They are the creators behind unique sneakers designed
with handloom. The art of handloom weaving involves the creation of textiles by
interlacing threads primarily made out of cotton (coloured with natural dyes), on a loom
operated manually. Pictured: Thamali Dharmawarden After almost 5 years of research, Common
Folk creates a breakthrough in the industry by discovering a production feasible method
that adds waterproofing functionality and abrasive level durability to traditional
handloom textiles. Sitting with Daily Mirror Life, Dharmawardena gives us an insight into
their story and the evolution of their work. “Common Folk is a homage to all the brilliant
people we have met and collecte dalong the way in the past 7-8 years. Firstly, Sharendra
and I consider ourselves common folk. Throughout the years, we have learned and grown with
the help of our talented artisans, tutors, technology partners, manufacturers, family,
friends, and colleagues. No matter our differences, our passion for our respective crafts
bind us. That passion and commitment make us all Common Folk."" Pictured: Sharendra Peiris
Q TELL US THE STORY OF HOW YOU GOT INTO HANDLOOM WEAVING? WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION BEHIND
PURSUING THIS TRADITIONAL CRAFT? Being very new to handloom weaving, it is actually less
than ten years since we began pursuing it. The first exposure to the craft was during my
second year in my BA programme. Our college took us to experience many different
traditional crafts. But something about creating a textile from scratch and watching the
weaving process in a handloom intrigued me the most. Being an analytical thinker, I then
dove into researching handloom textiles and the handloom market. During this research, it
became apparent to me that the Sri Lankan handloom market was on a decline. So our goal
became to sustain and uplift it. We started out by wanting to make something new and
unique that would open the handloom craft to much bigger opportunities. After years of R&D
(almost 5 years), we finally found a method to add the waterproof functionality to
handloom textiles. This was a breakthrough moment for us. But adding to our joy, we found
out that our waterproof handloom textiles were very durable, making it feasible to be used
in highly abrasive products. Being two people who love streetwear, Sharendra and I
immediately went for sneakers! Q CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A PAIR
OF SNEAKERS USING HANDLOOM TEXTILE? Initially, we start by selecting yarns and thread
compatible with our waterproofing technology. We also select them in the colours and
thicknesses we need. Our weavers then do their magic to warp the loom into our chosen
design and begin weaving. One thing we didn’t want to compromise on was the natural
sustainability and social sustainability factors of weaving handlooms. So once the designs
are masterfully woven, we clean up the fabric and send it to be waterproofed by our
locally based technology partners.This makes them extra durable too. Once done, we send
them to our shoe manufacturing partners (locally based) to turn our fabric into sneakers.
The entire process takes around 3-4 months. These shoes were the first product we launched
for the retail market. We have fondly named them after some cities and places we hold
dear. Are there any traditional techniques or tools that you incorporate into your weaving
process? Are there any particular designs or patterns that you specialize in? One of our
primary design innovations is the Ombre handloom, where the colours in the fabric areindistinguishable from one another, showing a smooth gradient effect. This technique is
far smoother in transition than any other we have seen in the market. Q YOU SURELY MIGHT
HAVE HAD/HAVE SOME CHALLENGES OR DIFFICULTIES YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME PURSUING TRADITIONAL
HANDLOOM? Yes definitely. We were relatively new to the handloom industry; we did not come
from a family of handloom weavers or have ever experienced anything about handloom before.
So our journey was not quick, short, or easy. But our purpose kept us going and helped us
jump through all the obstacles we encountered. One other thing is our process in handloom
right now is labour-intensive and very lengthy. We are combining three different
industries and markets to create one product, and the most challenging part is
coordinating with each of them to work smoothly. As we both have our day jobs, finding the
time is a big challenge. Everything else in creating the product, missteps and side steps
etc. we encounter are all part of the experience, and we don’t consider them to be
difficulties or challenges. They are more of a motivator for us. Q ASIDE HANDLOOM WOVEN
SNEAKERS, WHAT ARE OTHER PRODUCTS DO YOU WORK WITH? Our main innovation is waterproof
handloom fabrics. With this, we have created a few exciting products, like waterproof bags
and cushion covers. We are now experimenting with handloom umbrellas. We also currently
have 6 different fabric designs in two colourways, but we hope to expand this very soon. Q
COULD YOU SHARE WITH US ANY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES OR STORIES WHEN BOTH OF YOU BEGAN
PURSUING THIS CRAFT? I would say that all of our interactions with our artisans have been
and are very special to us. We work with one family and we have created an amazing bond
with them. We primarily collaborate with handloom weavers in Madampella. Latha and Bandula
are 2 such handloom artisans who throughout the years, have been our teachers, guides, and
sources of inspiration for Common Folk. Our fondest memory with them falls during the
period when we were developing the Ombre handloom technique. After weeks of experimenting,
we finally got to a point where the colours seamlessly blended and our efforts were
finally rewarded. The excitement and happiness we felt at that moment was unexplainable.
Sharing that with Latha and Bandula and watching the same reaction, when we first took our
shoes to them, made it so much sweeter. Their happiness to see the result of our work has
been the most gratifying feeling we have ever had as a brand. Q DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR
SOMEONE INTERESTED IN PURSUING HANDLOOM TEXTILE WEAVING ? The only advice we can give as a
start-up brand for anyone interested is to find your purpose. A shoe is a product, whether
it is made from handloom or not. Our sneakers are special to us because they were just the
beginning of something much more significant. Handlooms in our country have been a part of
our heritage and culture for many years. At one point, we had a thriving industry with
many factories and weaving mills. But in the past few decades,the industry has been
reaching a state of inertia. We see many handloom sellers who produce an identical product
range, often with the same aesthetics. This saturates the local market. So it is exciting
to see a few inspirational local brands stepping out of the norm to create new designs and
colour combinations to uplift the craft. At Common Folk, we believe our handloom sneakers
are just a stepping stone for the industry in Sri Lanka to grow in streetwear culture and
become enticing to the younger generations. text Nuzla Rizkiya Your comment (*)",8008
life_article_Inaugural_Launch_Of_The_Ceylon_Heritage_Festival_Fashion_Sho.pdf,"Inaugural Launch Of The Ceylon Heritage Festival Fashion Show
Sep 11 2023. The annual Ceylon Heritage Festival by the Rachel Raj Foundation and the
Ministry of Industries will have its inaugural launch with a fashion show dedicated to
artisanal traditional textile crafts on September 27 at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.
The event will serve as the launch pad for the new “Heritage Hands” label, a 100% Sri
Lankan-crafted clothing and accessory brand endorsed by the Industrial Development Board.
For years, Sri Lanka’s textile cottage industries have been one of the island’s best-kept
secrets. From our dumbara weavers in the hill country to our beeralu lace makers down
south and our palymrah fibre textiles from the north, nowhere in the world boasts the
unique craftsmanship and quality of these centuries-old artisanal textiles. The art of the
craft is privy to only a select few in rural Sri Lanka and has been passed down from
generation to generation in order to keep this art form alive. Unfortunately, being the
island's best-kept secret is slowly killing this indigenous craft as artisans struggle to
compete with the cheaper, lower-quality alternatives with little to no access or support
to enter new markets. Where countries like Mexico and Africa, which create unique
textiles, market their cultural crafts to the world, our traditional textiles fly under
the radar with limited global exposure. Coupled with soaring costs of living and finding
little opportunity in the industry, this generational heritage craft is on the decline and
very much at risk of disappearing altogether. Sarita Rajandran, Founder and Managing
Director of the Rachel Raj resort and swimwear brand which employs and works closely with
several artisans of the crafts for the luxury fashion label, is well aware of the
struggles these artistes face and believes that these traditional textile industries are
severely underutilised and undervalued. ""One of the reasons the cottage industries are
declining is that these crafts haven't been curated to cater to the modern palate. The
global market is crazy for traditional craftsmanship in fashion, but it needs to be modern
and wearable, and because we haven't developed our craft to blend in with the times, our
artisans are missing out on a huge market opportunity."" In celebration of her label's 10th
anniversary this year, Sarita founded the Rachel Raj Foundation to empower and promote
traditional textile crafts in international markets. Together with the Ministry of
Industries, under the guidance of the Minister, Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana and the
Industrial Development Board, the Ceylon Heritage Festival was conceptualised to showcase
Sri Lanka's heritage industries of fashion, art, music, literature, and more. While the
Festival is set to be an annual encounter, the inaugural event will be marked by a Fashion
Show this year, in a conscious effort to preserve the country's resources given the
current economic crunch. The Ceylon Heritage Festival Fashion Show will showcase the role
of Sri Lanka's indigenous textile crafts in modern design palettes with the launch of the
Heritage Hands label. The label will incorporate pieces where traditional crafts, such as
dumbara weaving, beeralu lace, bamboo and palmyra fibre fabric, crochet, handloom and
batik printing will be the mainstay of the collection. While these textile crafts are
often visualised in a traditional setting, the Heritage Hands collection juxtaposes the
old with the new, showcasing how effortlessly tradition and trend can combine to bridge
the gap between heritage and contemporary fashion. The show will also feature pieces
designed by the graduates of Moratuwa University's Fashion Textile Engineering department.
Following the launch of the brand, the Heritage Hands collection will be made available
exclusively at Laksala stores islandwide. Speaking on the IDB’s endorsement and support
given to the Festival and the Heritage Hands label, the Chairman of the IDB, Dr. Saranga
Alahapperuma shared that the Board together with the Ministry are looking positively at
this show as it is the first-ever fashion show dedicated solely to the cottage industries.
“Over 20,000 skilled artisans work in this industry, but sadly, because they aren't
utilising modern marketing techniques to expand into new markets and because theyfrequently target low-end local markets, there is little industry growth and very little
interaction from the younger generations because they don't see much future potential in
their craft right now. Because of this, we want to take it on and support these artisans
by making it easier for them to access new, international markets.” “The traditional
textile crafts produce very unique designs and high-quality, sustainable material. With
the fashion show and the label, I think buyers can see the versatility of this market and
we hope to take the craft offshore and give these artisans the support they need to pitch
to foreign buyers and international shows.” The Ceylon Heritage Festival Fashion Show will
be presented to foreign buyers and the diplomatic strata as well as the public in hopes of
attracting international buyers and fostering collaborations that can further boost the
export of these industries and pave the way to enter new markets. The Festival not only
aims to contribute to the growth of Sri Lanka's economy and bring exposure to
international markets but also, and perhaps more importantly, help preserve and pass down
the art of traditional textile crafting to future generations. Tickets are priced Rs. 5000
and are inclusive of the fashion show and cocktail beverages. Tickets will be available at
Ramani Fernando Salons - Elibank Road (Tuesday-Saturday 9.30 – 5pm) and Borella ( 9.30 –
5pm Daily) and Playtrix Sports Bar Colombo City Centre (11-6pm Daily). (Pix Courtesy: RRF)

life_article_Re-emerging_2000s_Fashion_Heres_how_to_style_it_for_2025_-_L.pdf,"Re-emerging 2000s Fashion: Here’s how to style it for 2025 - Ladies Edition
Sep 02 2024. As a stylist, you wouldn’t believe how much of my job is a scavenger hunt
based on the misplaced nostalgia of my clients. I like to think of Fashion trends as well-
placed nostalgia; that would be the rest of my job I have to keep track of. Fashion trends
are like that well-dressed aunt that refuses to let go of that top from the 70s she once
wore to a party, or anything that looks like it she’s brought ever since. Critically,
we’ve been cycling between the 20s to the 70s every few years, and then the 90s when it
all fails. This year we even hit the quirky ‘aughts (early 2000s) fashion archives. The
early 2000s were a time of bold fashion choices and experimental styles. As these trends
make a comeback in 2025, they bring with them a sense of nostalgia and fun. By
incorporating these key items into your wardrobe and styling them with a modern twist, you
can create looks that are both trendy and timeless. Whether you’re a fan of low-rise jeans
or waistcoats, there’s something for everyone in this revival of early 2000s fashion. 1.
Embellished Jeans Low-rise jeans were a staple of early 2000s fashion, often paired with
crop tops to show off the midriff. This trend is back, with a modern twist. Today’s low-
rise jeans come in various styles, from flared to skinny, and are often seen in distressed
or embellished designs. Stories went viral from spring/summer of beaded pants from the
Valentino show and that trend has now trickled down to rhinestone studded jean jackets and
straight cut/mom jeans for both men and women. Styling Tip : Pair your embellished jeans
with a fitted neutral-coloured crop top or a loose, oversized tee for a balanced look. Add
a pair of chunky sneakers to complete the outfit. 2. Mini Skirts Mini skirts were a
defining element of early 2000s fashion, often seen in denim or pleated styles. This trend
is back, with modern variations including leather and satin mini skirts as seen at the
CULT original, Mimosa & ELE Fashion. Styling Tip: Pair a mini skirt with a fitted shirt
for that brat aesthetic or a coordinated or mismatched waistcoat for that demure vibe.
Platform shoes would be best to elongate your legs and create a chic silhouette, but
chunky heels with a tie-up or strappy element are your next bet. Bonus points if you mix
in athletic socks, but I doubt Lankans would be that daring, 3. Baby Tees Baby tees,
characterised by their tight fit and cropped length, are another early 2000s trend making
a comeback. These tees are perfect for layering or wearing on their own for a casual,
laid-back look. Take it one step further with a tiny embroidery or print reminiscent of
the 90s. Styling Tip: Wear a baby tee with high-waisted jeans or a midi skirt. Layer with
a denim jacket or a cardigan for added warmth and style. 4. Cargo Pants Cargo pants, known
for their multiple pockets and relaxed fit, were a popular choice in the early 2000s. They
are now being reintroduced with a more tailored and streamlined design. Lighter and chic’
fabrics as well as colour tones that are a pastel lavender are very much Gen Z as well as
Gen Alpha. Even the accessories used with it (zips, tags and tacks) all echo tech wear
influences of the past few years for a fresh new look for men and women alike and they are
a sure hit as I seem to never find them in the appropriate size when I’m looking for them
at any retailer in town. Styling Tip: Pair cargo pants with a fitted tank top or a
bodysuit. Add a pair of chunky boots or sneakers for a utilitarian yet fashionable look.
5. Halter Tops Halter tops, which tie around the neck and leave the shoulders bare, were a
popular choice for both casual and dressy occasions in the early 2000s. This trend is
back, with updated fabrics and cutouts at the sides, not to mention full maxi-length dress
variations that lean into futuristic aesthetics brought on by our dystopian movies as of
late. Styling Tip: Wear a halter top with high-waisted trousers or a maxi skirt. Add gold
bauble style statement earrings and a clutch that’s rubber or sequin pieced for a
sophisticated evening look. 6. Denim on Denim The double denim trend, often referred to as
the “Canadian tuxedo,” was a hallmark of early 2000s fashion (please try to forget ‘this
will ruin the world tour’ JT & Britney matching set). This trend is making a comeback witha more polished and coordinated approach with darker tones in looser fits and making sure
it’s perceived as a more smart casual outfit than anything else. Styling Tip: Pair a denim
jacket with matching jeans or a denim skirt. Keep the look cohesive by choosing similar
washes and adding neutral accessories. A fashion stylist with a decade of experience as an

ceremonial and festive-fusion collection that is unrivalled in its decadence and one-of-a-
kind artistry.” The debut showcase of Khayal’s first collection will take place at the
Earl’s Regency Hotel, Kandy on 11 February 2023. Kandy, being the island's cultural
capital, is surrounded by a rich history and tradition; making it the perfect destination
to launch Khayal. The collection offers a wide range of luxurious lehengas, an exquisite
range of sarees, three-piece formal suits, designer jackets, one-of-a-kind blazers, and
sherwanis. The elegant new segment offers the ultimate wedding wardrobe for both brides
and grooms featuring breath-taking looks for any occasion and ceremonial celebrations.
Khayal features more than 100 one-of-a-kind styles with modern silhouettes that cater to
the bride, groom, and wedding guests. The fashion show consists of segments of evening
wear, occasion-worthy outfits, wedding guest attires, and a stunning bridal collection for
the finale. The designs are hand-picked in distinctive colours and fabrics with intricate
embroideries from a gloriously rich Indian aesthetic. The colour palette for Khayal
consists of dreamy shades of white through romantic pastels to bold magentas in a range of
luxe fabrics such as lace, tulle, satin, and sequin. The men’s collection also highlights
signature tailoring, the modern design aesthetics and includes versatile prints and
patterns. “Hindu brides are faced with limitations for bridalwear locally. We are
delighted to expand the range of South Indian-influenced outfits and kanchipuram sarees to
offer more opulence. Traditionally from the South of India, these sarees are made of heavy
silk by skilled craftsmen and come in bold, bright colours with elaborate patterns,”
Dhinushika noted. Also speaking at the press conference, Brides of Sri Lanka Founder and
Managing Director Nelum Haththella stated: “Brides Of Sri Lanka is the official bridal
magazine partner for the showcase. At a time like this, it is imperative that media
organisations portray a positive image of Sri Lanka and the wedding industry.” Popular
local clothing brand Moose Clothing, which has been showcasing its versatile casual
clothing range at Sriyani Dress Point, has come on board as the main sponsor for thisevent. Lassana Flora, a leader in the floral industry known for producing the best floral
arrangements in Sri Lanka, will be the floral and decoration partner. Earl’s Regency, one
of the finest hotels in Kandy, will be the official hospitality and venue partner, while
Haut Monde Event Management is the official event and PR partner. Your comment (*)",4706

Apr 22 2025. Each year, Avurudu celebrations bring about a vibrant explosion to our
wardrobes either as gifts or purchases. Once in my childhood it was a bright yellow that
needed to be mixed and managed, or a royal purple that blossomed into traditional wear
that felt like an acquired taste. No matter the colour, the Aluth Avurudu period brings
together communities through this one aspect that I wanted to draw some special attention
just in case you missed it. One of the most fascinating aspects of this festival for me is
the emphasis on auspicious coloured clothing; Most of us take the directive quite blindly
from whichever source we read or listen to and allow it to play a central role in the
rituals and traditions of the coming New Year celebrations. But little do we recognize
that these colours are not just decorative; they carry deep cultural, historical, and even
astrological significance that have faded into obscurity. The tradition of incorporating
auspicious colors into New Year celebrations dates back centuries by all historical
accounts. Even in ancient records, the selection of these colours was a meticulous process
guided by astrologers in the hopes of uniting communities and families. In Vedic
astrology, certain colours are considered auspicious and are linked to planetary
alignments and zodiac signs. For example, red is associated with Mars and Aries, while
yellow is linked to Jupiter and Sagittarius. These colours are believed to bring positive
energy and harmony when used appropriately; they were also believed to bring good fortune,
prosperity to the home and to the nation with each ritual they were associated with. Now
thanks to a widely accessible ‘Litha’ (Sinhalese Almanac formulated by the foremost
astrological experts) that’s eagerly anticipated towards the end of each year - even
online – every mass market or retail clothing brand you know is keen on its information to
start designs and purchasing so that they are ready for the upcoming period. Most families
eagerly await the announcement of the ""nekath"" (auspicious times) and the corresponding
colours to wear as mentioned in the Litha. While staunch belief and practice might be hazy
on all the steps involved in the traditions of the new year, most people still rigidly
follow the auspicious colours as a ‘better safe than sorry’ approach to ensuring a
prosperous year ahead. To most of rural Sri Lanka, the tradition of auspicious colours
remains a cherished aspect of Avurudu celebrations. These colours influence everything
from the attire people wear to the decorations in their homes and even the food served
during the celebrations. As Sri Lanka continues to evolve, so too does the celebration of
Aluth Avurudu. The significance of these colors goes beyond aesthetics. By embracing the
auspicious colours, people feel a sense of connection to their cultural heritage and the
cosmic rhythms that govern their lives. The tradition of auspicious colors is likely to
remain a cornerstone of the festival, but it may also adapt to modern sensibilities. For
example, with the growing emphasis on sustainability, there could be a shift towards using
eco-friendly materials and natural dyes to incorporate these colours into clothing.
Currently Avurudu period ensures a strong uptick in traditional crafts related purchases
and a strong move towards traditional clothing such as Handloom, Batiks and locally
produced clothing. The auspicious colours of Sri Lanka's New Year celebrations are more
than just a visual delight; they are a vibrant thread that weaves together history,
culture, and community. As the festival continues to evolve, these colours will
undoubtedly remain a symbol of hope, renewal, and unity, reminding us of the timeless
beauty of tradition in a rapidly changing world. As much as Avurudu brings together a warm
fuzzy feeling across the country over traditions and families, it is a celebration that is
much anticipated by the commercial industries of the country. Fashion retailers and
clothing brands invest heavily into this season offering clothing for every aspect of the
celebration as well as gift giving. Most of the items on offer are balloon sleeved or
print pocketed which limits use for just this period, but most consumers are none thewiser and happy to purchase new items for use. Most avurudu purchases end up being one-off
items that are never thought of again for the rest of the year until it’s a paduru party,
hopper night or another unironic sarong related event. If you are someone who purchased
your auspicious coloured clothing with some foresight, the more solid coloured or minimal
styled items could easily be split and paired and used for the day to day or even special
occasions. Avurudu clothing might be another factor on the negative side of fast fashion,
but Sri Lankans rarely throw away clothes to landfills unless it's in tatters, so there is
always that silver lining. I highly recommend giving these items a try in your monthly
rotation; if not, donate or pass on to a friend who might benefit from it. There was a
strange intersection this year between the auspicious colour of the year being Copper and
most fashion retailers offering us a range of rich reds and bright browns. I wonder if it
had anything to do with this year's Pantone Colour of the year being “Mocha Mousse” – a
lovely shade of brown on its own, and the sudden uptick of brown as a Gen-Z adult
favourite. From trousers to crop tops to cable knit polos, Mocha and Copper are colours
that are widely available at the moment in Sri Lanka. Maybe this is the one year Avurudu
clothing can be a whole year long exercise in slow fashion. Or maybe even reach deeper
into those wardrobes, reminisce about Avurudus that have passed by wearing colours that
are definitely not the auspicious color of the year, but give you a certain sense of
nostalgia for the luck or prosperity they brought at that time. A fashion stylist with a

life_article_The_Great_Fit_Fallacy_and_Other_Myths_That_Shape_How_Men_Dre.pdf,"The Great Fit Fallacy and Other Myths That Shape How Men Dress Today
Jul 15 2025. By Gayantha Perera For a species that once wrapped itself in loincloths and
called it a day, men have come a long way in fashion. Or have they? In 2025, we’re living
in a world where men’s closets are bigger, sneaker collections are sacred, and grooming
kits have their own PR reps. Yet, a few persistent myths still shape how men dress—and not
always in the most liberating ways. This month of inclusivity, I wanted to discuss gender
and what not directly. Let’s pop the buttons off some of these outdated beliefs and see
what’s really going on. Myth #1: Tailoring is Only for Suits and Special Occasions
Somewhere along the way, tailoring got typecast as something reserved for elites. Special
occasions or weddings, or that one time a guy needed to borrow a suit for a graduation.
But the truth? Tailoring is simply the art of making clothes actually fit your body. If
you are looking in the mirror and your shirt feels like it doesn’t fit, or your pants feel
long -I can’t believe I’m saying this – you can get them tailored for the perfect fit!
Whether it’s hemming your trousers, tapering your shirt, or just learning your shoulder
width, a good fit is the secret sauce behind style that looks effortless. You can be
wearing a hand-me-down blazer and still look like a million bucks if it’s tailored right.
And no, tailoring isn’t only for suits. That denim jacket? Those cargos? Your favourite
joggers? If they fit like they were made for you, congratulations—you’re tailored. Myth
#2: Athleisure Means You’ve Given Up There’s a persistent, snobby whisper in the wind that
says men who wear sweatpants in public have surrendered to the void. But modern athleisure
is anything but lazy. It’s intentional comfort, elevated design, and functionality wrapped
in one stretchy waistband. Athleisure has become a style ecosystem of its own—with local
brands like Carnage, F.O.A, and international legends like Adidas & Nike nailing the blend
between sleek and sporty. The 2020s man isn’t dressing for the gym or the couch. He’s
dressing for everything in between. Zoom call at 10, lunch run at 12, and a casual date at
7? Athleisure’s got your back (and glutes – if you're lucky). Myth #3: Real Men Wear
Neutrals Let’s be real—somewhere along the line, society decided that the male colour
wheel should begin and end with black, grey, navy, and maybe olive if he’s feeling spicy.
Enter colour theory, the underrated MVP of men’s fashion. Colours communicate. A pastel
pink shirt? That guy probably has emotional intelligence and knows his coffee order down
to the ratio of milk and water. A burnt orange hoodie? He doesn’t need validation—he is
the vibe. Skin tone, personality, and personal story all play into what colours resonate.
Luckily, consumer brands are catching on. I am impressed to see mass market retailers in
Sri Lanka are now pushing softer palettes and bold colour-blocking into menswear, and both
young and old consumers have favourite colours outside dark palettes. So if you’ve always
wanted to wear lavender but held back… consider this your permission slip. Myth #4:
Celebrities Know What They’re Doing It’s tempting to build a wardrobe by copying
celebs—after all, they have stylists, access, and a bottomless Gucci budget. But that’s
also the trap. The truth? Many male celebrities dress like they’re in a perpetual fashion
dare. For every Timothée Chalamet moment that pushes boundaries, there’s a dozen confusing
attempts involving leather kilts, cowboy hats, or full-on Renaissance cosplay. Do they
pull it off? Sometimes. Should you copy them? Not unless it aligns with your own style
DNA. What you can take from celebs is confidence. Stylespiration is fair game, but
imitation without adaptation usually ends in regret—or at least awkward photos. Myth #5:
Brands Define Your Style Here’s the mind-bender: the brands you wear say something, but
not everything. In a time when brand loyalty is big business, men are often told that
identity = label. But having your whole personality bottled in one logo is kind of
limiting, no? That said, brands do understand their demographic—and some are getting
better at speaking directly to modern men. From Deedat’s clean minimalism to Darlee’s
vintage-urban nostalgia to GFLOCKs inclusive sizing and styling—there’s something outthere for everyone. But the best-dressed guys aren’t just followers of a brand’s story.
They remix it with their own narrative. So, Where Does That Leave Us? Fashion myths are
stubborn. They’re usually born from outdated norms, lazy marketing, or good old-fashioned
insecurity. But the men rewriting the rulebook today are the ones leaning into comfort,
experimenting with colour, and shaping identity through clothes—not in spite of it. Style
isn’t about myth-following. It’s about myth-busting. The modern man’s closet isn’t just
about what he wears—it’s about who he dares to be. A fashion stylist with a decade of

life_article_The_Story_Of_La_Vivente__A_socially_conscious_apparel_brand.pdf,"The Story Of La Vivente: A socially conscious apparel brand
Aug 24 2023. Many individuals have taken it upon themselves to empower fellow citizens in
various capacities. La Vivente, a trending apparel brand has a similar story. Its founder
Dr. Dilesha Perera, aims to empower women in the outskirts of Colombo by providing them
with employment opportunities. In an interview with Daily Mirror Life, Dr Perera spoke
about how the brand came into being, her aspirations to empower women in the country and
why parents should encourage their children to follow their passion. Excerpts : Q TELL US
ABOUT YOURSELF.. I initiated my journey in the retail sector while I was at university.
During this period, I engaged in procuring stock lots, which I then distributed to
prominent retailers across the island. In 2005, fate led me to meet my husband, who, like
me, was a banker. Together, in 2007, we embarked on a new endeavour: manufacturing. Our
banking background unveiled a concerning trend—people faced hurdles in securing bank loans
due to a lack of collateral. This observation catalyzed our decision to shift our focus.
In 2016, I left my banking career to dedicate myself entirely to this venture. In due
course, we introduced a micro-entrepreneur programme with the goal of empowering women
within the country. Our initiative involved identifying individuals possessing sewing
skills. We provided the designs to them and guaranteed a market while they executed the
sewing for us. By equipping them with necessary machinery or other requirements, we
enabled them to launch their own businesses. To date, our efforts have resulted in
collaborating with over 20 micro-entrepreneurs, generating approximately 300 employment
opportunities. Q WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE BRAND LA VIVENTE? The inception of the brand
La Vivente took place just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operational
model involved collaborating with various retail chains, and our workflow was intricately
tied to their orders. This setup presented challenges, as we were obligated to provide
work for our micro-entrepreneurs irrespective of order fluctuations. To address this
dilemma, we strategized a shift and transitioned into the realm of retail. This marked the
birth of the La Vivente brand. The name “La Vivente,” meaning ‘the living’ in Italian, was
chosen purposefully to mirror our vision of enabling livelihoods for our entrepreneurs.
However, shortly after we embarked on this new path, the pandemic emerged, temporarily
shuttering the market. In response, we swiftly pivoted to online sales, commencing with a
modest order volume that gradually gained momentum. The timing aligned with the shift in
consumer behaviour from offline to online, and our product line, marked by its
affordability and cultural fusion in design, resonated well with market demands. In 2020,
we inaugurated our first store in Galle, followed by subsequent openings in Koswatte and
Negombo in 2021, driven by meticulous research. The year 2022 witnessed the establishment
of our fourth store in Kandy, succeeded by another in Colombo this year. Our footprint
extends beyond borders, encompassing Australia, New Zealand, and the UAE. Our achievements
have not gone unnoticed. We proudly secured the esteemed ‘Best SME Local Brand’ Gold Award
and clinched the Bronze Award for Best New Entrant Brand at the SLIM Brand Excellence
Awards. Notably, our digital presence garnered recognition, as we secured the BestWeb.lk
Gold Award for the best SME website in 2022. Moreover, in 2022, I was honoured with the
title of Asia’s Most Outstanding Women Marketer of the Year by the Asia Marketing
Federation. Q HOW ARE THE MICRO ENTREPRENEURS SELECTED FOR THE WORKFORCE? We receive
inquiries from interested individuals, to whom we subsequently provide a sample task. This
enables us to assess their sewing capabilities in alignment with our quality standards.
Following this initial evaluation, we offer guidance and support. Often, they come
accompanied by one or two colleagues. Our process begins with a skill assessment, followed
by an evaluation of their potential to establish independent enterprises. Q HOW IS LA
VIVENTE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CLOTHING STORES? La Vivente stands out for its commitment to
empowering women and nurturing their growth. We are not just a fashion brand; we are acommunity that supports and celebrates women in all their endeavours. Our clothes are not
just about looking good; they symbolise empowerment and confidence. Q THE APPAREL SECTOR
IS ONE OF THE MAIN INCOME GENERATORS IN THE COUNTRY. TELL US ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTION MADE
BY LA VIVENTE. Certainly, La Vivente has significantly contributed to the apparel sector,
serving as a noteworthy income generator within the country. Our impact is twofold, i.e.
economic empowerment for micro-entrepreneurs and a distinct presence in the market. La
Vivente has pioneered a micro-entrepreneur programme that has transformed the lives of
numerous individuals. By identifying individuals with sewing skills and providing them
with opportunities to start their own businesses, we have directly contributed to income
generation at the grassroots level. Our support encompasses design, pattern-making, and
the provision of necessary machinery. This initiative has resulted in the establishment of
over 20 micro-entrepreneurs who are now creating employment opportunities for themselves
and others. These entrepreneurs not only contribute to their household incomes but also
contribute to the overall economic growth of the country. La Vivente has pioneered a

These entrepreneurs not only contribute to their household incomes but also contribute to
the overall economic growth of the country. In summary, La Vivente’s contribution to the
apparel sector encompasses not only economic gains through entrepreneurship but also the
enhancement of the market’s diversity and appeal. Q HAVE YOU CONSIDERED INVOLVING THE
YOUTH IN YOUR VENTURE? Absolutely, involving the youth has been a core focus of our
venture at La Vivente. Recognizing the energy, innovation, and fresh perspectives that the
younger generation brings, we have taken deliberate steps to engage and empower them. On a
personal level, I actively foster entrepreneurship within the university to ignite
enthusiasm among the younger generation. Our initiatives encompass various engagement
avenues, including buddy programmes and sponsorships for university events like fashion
shows. Notably, we recently collaborated with a prominent local designer to provide
training for undergraduates, equipping them to participate in a fashion show. This
experience not only showcased their talents but also exposed them to real-world industry
dynamics. For those pursuing fashion design in universities, we extend internship
opportunities within our stores. This hands-on experience allows them to bridge the gap
between classroom learning and practical application, fostering their growth within the
fashion sector. By engaging with university students and cultivating their interest in
entrepreneurship and fashion, we contribute to their personal and professional
development, while also nurturing a future generation of creative minds. Q FASHION
DESIGNING IS A CAREER PATH THAT IS IN HIGH DEMAND TODAY. WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO PARENTS?
Parents should empower their children to pursue their passions and become the individuals
they aspire to be. Providing support for their chosen paths enables them to achieve
greater success. It’s important to recognize that fashion designing is a specialized
career that may not be suitable for everyone. However, for those with an inclination,
there exists a multitude of opportunities. Fashion design resonates with a universal
appeal, as it taps into something that resonates with people on a personal level. By
fostering an environment that encourages the pursuit of passions, we enable our youth to
unlock their potential and contribute meaningfully to various fields, including the
captivating world of fashion. PICS BY Pradeep Pathirana Your comment (*)",8610
life_article_Wardrobe_Warrior.pdf,"Wardrobe Warrior
Apr 07 2025. Sarita Rajendran's mission to empower Sri Lankan Women on personal style and
fashion A lifelong devotee of fashion, Sarita Rajendran used the quiet of the pandemic as
a chance to turn passion into purpose, qualifying as a certified stylist and deepening her
understanding of the art and science behind style. The experience was eye-opening—it
revealed just how much more there is to styling beyond surface-level aesthetics. This
journey sparked the idea for Wardrobe Warrior, a book that had been long in the making,
designed to empower Sri Lankan women with practical tools to build a wardrobe that
reflects their individuality, lifestyle, and budget. Written in both English and Sinhala,
Wardrobe Warrior fills a long-standing gap in fashion education in Sri Lanka. It caters to
a diverse audience—from women who can afford high-end wardrobes but lack guidance, to
those with limited means who still deserve to feel stylish and confident. The book offers
practical advice on dressing for different life stages and occasions, from pregnancy to
peri -menopause, and emphasizes working with, not against, South Asian body types and
cultural norms. Proceeds from the book support the training of new Dumbara weaving
artisans—a cause close to the author’s heart. Wardrobe Warrior is more than a style guide;
it's a celebration of self-expression, culture, and community. What inspired you to write
Wardrobe Warrior, and how long has the idea been in the making? I have always been an
ardent follower of fashion. During the pandemic, I took the opportunity to deepen my
understanding of the subject and qualified as a stylist. Through this course of study, I
discovered just how much there is to the art of styling. It made me realise that a book on
this topic—available in both English and Sinhala—would be a valuable resource, especially
for the women of our country. I also contribute some funding for thread used by the
Dumbara weavers when they train new artisans, most of the proceeds of these books will go
towards this exercise. 2. You’ve long been a fixture on Colombo’s best-dressed lists. How
does this book reflect your personal journey with fashion? The older you get, you become
more comfortable in your skin , your shape , dress size etc. I think I have addressed
issues that women face from what to wear to your workplace , pregnancy as well as Peri-
menopause . It is essential to understand all these elements, and as south Asians, our
bodies are made very differently to the west, therefore it is essential to understand
elements that define our culture and work around them instead of against it. 3. What do
you hope readers will take away from Wardrobe Warrior—is it more about confidence, style,
or self-expression? There is a large Sinhalese speaking population in the country who are
able to afford a beautifully curated wardrobe , but may not necessarily know how to curate
one. Likewise there are those who cannot afford to do the same. I have addressed how to
budget accordingly and written guidelines as how you can curate a wardrobe. 4. Can you
tell us about the process of curating the content for the book—how did you decide what
style advice to include? After I qualified as a certified stylist I learned a lot that I
didn't know about wardrobe curation. I also feel that a large part of the population in
Sri Lanka has access to beautiful clothes at very reasonable prices unlike 25 years ago.
But personal style is lacking and that is one of the reasons I decided to go ahead with
this publication in Sinhalese as well. It took me almost 2 years to compile the English
publication. 5. In a world dominated by fast fashion and trends, how does Wardrobe Warrior
encourage people to build a timeless, authentic wardrobe? You have to read the book to
find out. I have an entire section on how to budget your wardrobe. However as a stylist it
is much easier when you have more affordable retail outlets to choose from. In particular
for those who don't have a big budget to curate a wardrobe but need to! 6. You’re known
for your fearless fashion choices. Does the book explore the idea of taking risks with
personal style? It gives a clear guide to developing personal style accordingly. Again,
one has to read the book. I have written a few chapters on this subject . 7. Was there aspecific moment or experience in your career that made you realize people needed guidance
with their fashion identity? Yes, many, many times. Dressing according to climate,
occasion , pairing colours , accessories and choosing the correct shoes!! Your comment (*)",4602

life_fashion90_10_Concept_2019.pdf,"Concept 2019
Nov 26 2018. One of the key players in the Sri Lankan men’s fashion industry, Fouzul
Hameed presented his annual show Concept 2019 under the theme ‘Black’. Inspired by his
travels around Italy, especially the architecture, colours, people and everything in
between, he said that this show placed emphasis on wedding attire. As a veteran in the
industry with almost three decades of experience under his belt, he prides himself
in creating an excellent array of customized wedding attire and felt this show was the
best opportunity to highlight what he does best. Six fashion segments highlighted the
various types of eastern and western attire suitable for a bridegroom. That said, the
fashionable ensembles would suit guests attending a wedding too. The first segment, Black,
showcased a collection of sharp outfits comprising of suits and kurtas teamed with
sarongs. This was followed by Destination Tropical which had a collection of outfits more
suited for the outdoors. Think beach weddings with lots of natural colours and bow ties
and cravats complementing the outfits and adding a pop of colour. The South Asian segment
consisted of elegant Nehru jackets with pleat details and super sharp tailoring. Inspired
by many parts of Sri Lanka, the Ceylon Pride collection was all about national suits in a
variety of delicate colours that ranged from neutral tones of mushroom and oatmeal to
cream and ivory. All complemented with very delicate embroidery on the placket. The Summer
Wedding segment featured single breasted jackets teamed with striped ties and bright
shirts which added a pop of colour. Slim fit pants and dapper waistcoats teamed with
stylish jackets were shown alongside linen sarongs and smart blazers which lent an air of
summer sophistication to this collection. The final collection titled Ceremonial Luxe was
all about three piece suits in brushed velvet and fine Italian fabrics. They featured
contrasting lapels and embossed fabric which added a luxurious feel to the collection. The
design maestro that he is, Fouzul Hameed’s desire to diversify and innovate looks for men
to stand out from the crowd at ceremonial, western weddings, national, Indian, beachwear
and home coming occasions in trendy and fashionable designs was realized at this event. It
was an inspired wedding collection for men which reflected the new style ideas for grooms
to make an impression on their wedding day. Navigating men’s suits can be tricky at the
best of times and this is where Fouzul Hameed steps in. His Envoy brand creates some of
the best locally made suits in the country. Using the finest of fabrics, many flown down
especially from select fabric mills in Italy, FH as he is known in the local fashion
sphere, is a stickler for detail which is evident not only for the details but also for
the superlative finish of his suits. A man who has his finger on the pulse, FH also
believes in keeping things affordable which is great news for those working to a tight
budget. His ultimate dream though is to create a new generation of Sri Lankan gentleman
and to achieve this, at the show he gave guests a preview of the new YouTube channel he
has launched which explains all aspects of styling and clothing. “ I want to coach people
on how to be a gentleman. That’s my dream. What I preach I can practice. I can coach them
and manufacture clothes for them which goes hand in hand with my vision of creating a
perfect Sri Lankan gentleman” he said. FH continues to uplift menswear fashion in Sri
Lanka and every year he ups the ante and presents stunning collections which have a wide
appeal for men. This year was no exception! Photos by: Manoj Ratnayake Tina Edward

life_fashion90_10_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_Day_3.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week Day 3
Aug 16 2020. The final day of HSBC Colombo Fashion Week 2020 drew to a close at the Hilton
with a large number of fashion aficionados turning out to support the red-letter event in
Sri Lanka's fashion calendar. Several of Sri Lanka's leading designers presented
collections which were diverse in design. The Old Railway Galle based designer Catherine
Rawson is known for her eclectic outfits. Using vintage fabrics donated a fellow Galle
resident the fabrics used range from chiffon to linen and raw silk to viscose all
different but complementing each other perfectly. The collection featured a range of
separates which will work well from the cocktail circuit to a festival. Hippy silhouettes
adorned with bold prints paired with flawless cuts helped to make this collection more
relevant now than ever. Amilani Perera This year, in partnership with the United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) in Sri Lanka, the fashion brand 'Amilani Perera' showcased a
unique collection that uplifts and empowers women who have faced domestic violence in Sri
Lanka. The Collection, ‘UNBREAKABLE', stays true to Amilani Perera’s vision for the brand,
which is to provide the wearer with a truly unique garment and to give back to society.
With hand paintings by Amilani transformed into prints to lush dyed silk ombrés, and
through the intricate pieces being brought together by survivors of violence, the
collection is a display of intense emotions brought to life through a meaningful colour
palette. Short flirty dresses vied for attention alongside sheer caped tops paired with
cigarette pants. This collection bore all the hallmarks of Amilani’s inimitable style. In
a response to the pollution that has beset the environment, Kamil’s collection titled
Purity collection showcases what purity should be and could be if we all take the
destruction of our environment seriously and bring it back to its former splendour.
Elegantly tailored outfits in crisp white with accent colours of mint helped Kamil create
a dramatic entrance on the runway. Eye-catching statement sleeves made this collection
stand out. Exquisite crisp white lace printed net and embossed prints added to its
aesthetic appeal. In crisp white, a multitude of features created sensual and romantic
looks. It was a riot of colour when Jaishree presented her collection in typical jewel-box
colours. Jumpsuits and mini dresses with oversized bustle bows and hot pants with a
billowing cape and saree formed the mainstay of this collection. Deriving inspiration from
the preserved ancient trading port of Hoi An, Vietnam the collection encapsulates elements
of saffron yellow French colonial structures, speckled with flickering lanterns of Fuchsia
and the emerald green rice fields. Navel grazing necklines added an element of daring to
the collection while the puffball dresses with endless volumes, gave a nod to Madame de
Pompadour. Designer Sharmilla Ruberu draws her inspiration for this season from the artist
James Turrell and his work of ‘Sky spaces’- He is an artist who triggers a very personal
sensory experience where the viewer becomes ’The Artist’. The collection of men and
womenswear had an aura of delicateness largely due to raw silk strips woven with
engineered precision to create oversized jackets and formed the focal point in some of the
dresses. Silks were printed in delicate shades which helped inject a vibe of simplicity to
this lovely collection in rich colours of orange eggplant and red. Closing the show on the
final day of Colombo Fashion Week Charini presented a functional collection of everyday
wear. In the main, this collection comprised belted dresses shirt dresses jumpsuits and
saris. However, she did include a few glam dresses with navel grazing necklines and sarees
to show her versatility as a designer. The collection was designed and manufactured with
responsibility in fashion in mind and uses batik craft and timeless versatile design which
will prolong the lifetime of each garment. Clothing for the everyday. The clothing you
want to wear. Refined, classic and purposeful. Indi’s collection embodies the CFW tag of
Responsible fashion. She delivered a sustainable fashion collection representing her
signature sophisticated look and feel. Using eco-friendly textiles from organic cotton,organza silk and linen the collection featured hand-painted floral patterns (Using Earth
Pigments and Soy Milk), easy effortless silhouettes and flowy dresses, sheer fabrics,
shirt collars, billowing sleeves and ruffs. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_10_Kosh_Hewage_A_New_Era_for_Miss_Universe_Bahrain_and_Egypt.pdf,"Kosh Hewage: A New Era for Miss Universe Bahrain and Egypt
Jun 23 2025. By Sharuni Weerasinghe In a groundbreaking appointment, Sri Lankan creative
visionary Kosh Hewage has been named the Deputy Director of Miss Universe Bahrain and Miss
Universe Egypt, marking a historic moment as the first Sri Lankan to hold a leadership
role in an international pageant representing another country. Known for his experience as
a celebrity stylist and CEO of The Agency Sri Lanka, Hewage now brings his creative flair
and leadership acumen to a global platform. We sat down with him to talk about his vision,
responsibilities, and how his journey from styling Barbie dolls to commanding
international stages came full circle. Q: Congratulations on your appointment. How does it
feel to be named Deputy Director of Miss Universe Bahrain and Egypt? I’m extremely happy
and truly honoured. Being the first Sri Lankan to be part of an international franchise at
this level is not just a personal achievement but a proud moment for Sri Lanka. I’ve been
warmly welcomed into the House of Yugen family by Josh Yugen, Ian, and the entire
team—it’s been incredible. I’m grateful for the opportunity to contribute to a platform
that celebrates the strength, beauty, and voice of Arab and Islamic women on a global
stage. Q: What does this new role mean to you personally and professionally? It’s a
milestone, absolutely—but more than that, it’s a responsibility. This isn’t just a title;
it’s a commitment to excellence and integrity. The Miss Universe brand is globally
recognised, and with it comes the expectation to lead with vision and purpose. Personally,
it’s fulfilling a lifelong dream. Professionally, it’s an opportunity to shape a platform
that empowers the next generation of Arab women. Q: How do you plan to bring your
background as a celebrity stylist into this role? While I won’t be styling the candidates
myself, my experience does influence the creative direction. I bring an understanding of
branding, aesthetics, and cultural sensitivity. Our team is incredibly talented, and my
goal is to help guide a vision that respects regional traditions while presenting
something fresh and globally competitive. It’s about blending authenticity with elegance
and modernity. Q: What is your vision for Miss Universe Bahrain under your leadership?
We’re aiming to find a woman who’s not just beautiful, but bold, intelligent, and
compassionate—a woman of substance who can inspire others and drive change. Our goal is to
turn the spotlight toward fearless Arab women who are proud of their heritage and bold in
their dreams. This platform isn’t just about a crown; it’s about amplifying a cause. Q:
Pageantry in the Middle East faces unique challenges. How will you balance innovation with
cultural representation? Thoughtful planning, cultural respect, and authenticity are key.
One example is our decision to include the ‘Burkini’ during the swimsuit segment,
honouring modesty without compromising empowerment. Every choice- from wardrobe to
messaging- is intentional. We want Arab and Islamic women to feel celebrated and
represented without diluting their identity. Q: What sets Miss Universe Bahrain apart on
the global stage? Our diversity and unity are our greatest strengths. We’re a team of
creatives and professionals from the Philippines, Sri Lanka, UAE, India, and Bahrain
working together with one goal—to bring Bahrain to the forefront of global pageantry.
Shereen Ahmed, our reigning queen, is a perfect example of what we stand for: grace,
advocacy, and authenticity. Q: How have your styling experiences prepared you for this
leadership role? My 15-year career in fashion taught me how to work with people, manage
talent, and stay adaptable. Running The Agency Sri Lanka helped me grow as a mentor and
strategist. Each project sharpened my ability to think creatively while navigating real-
world challenges. These experiences built the foundation I now stand on. Q: Can you share
a bit about your personal journey? It all began with designing outfits for my sister’s
Barbie dolls and staging mock pageants in our living room! I was captivated by the blend
of poise, beauty, and impact that pageants offered. That passion led me to study
Management at Plymouth University via NSBM, which helped me merge creativity with businessstrategy. From winning ‘Designer of the Year’ to showcasing at the Asian-European Fashion
Week in Paris, every step was a stepping stone. Becoming National Director for Miss Earth
Sri Lanka in 2021 was a turning point. Now, this new chapter with Miss Universe Bahrain
feels like a dream realised. Q: How do you see the fashion and beauty industry
evolving—and where do you fit in that shift? Globally, fashion has become more than
aesthetics—it’s about identity, inclusivity, and activism. But in Sri Lanka, we’re still
navigating traditional perceptions. I see myself as a bridge, bringing global standards
and progressive ideas to a developing market. I want to help local talent rise, break
stereotypes, and redefine what it means to be stylish and powerful in today’s world. Q:
What message do you hope your appointment sends to aspiring creatives? Believe in
yourself, but don’t rush the process. Stay kind, work hard, and support others.
Collaboration always beats competition. Learn from every experience and be generous with
what you know. Most importantly, never compromise your authenticity—that’s where your true
power lies. Q: Are there any exciting projects coming up for Miss Universe Bahrain? Yes!
We have several mini pageants, a charity gala, and the crowning ceremony—all in the works.
While I can’t reveal too much, I promise this year’s edition will be unforgettable. We’re
pouring our hearts into making it impactful and elegant, with a strong emphasis on finding
a winner who can shine on the Miss Universe stage and beyond. Q: What advice would you
give to someone hoping to break into fashion, styling, or event direction internationally?
Start now—don’t wait for permission. Be ready to work behind the scenes, stay disciplined,
and evolve constantly. The industry is fast and competitive, so reputation matters as much
as talent. Build authentic relationships, stay curious, and above all, be consistent. If
you put in the work with passion and humility, the world will notice. As Kosh Hewage steps
into this new chapter, he brings not just experience and vision but a deep sense of
purpose. His journey from a young dreamer in Sri Lanka to Deputy Director of Miss Universe
Bahrain and Egypt is a testament to what happens when creativity meets discipline and
passion is fueled by purpose. With Hewage helping steer the ship, the future of Miss
Universe Bahrain and Miss Universe Egypt promises to be as bold, inclusive, and boundary-
breaking. Your comment (*)",6823
life_fashion90_10_Minimalist_Chic_-_LAtelier_Touché.pdf,"Minimalist Chic - L’Atelier Touché
Aug 07 2018. Designer duo Heidy Rampinelli and Catherine Obrenovic are a fashion force to
be reckoned with. The founders of L’Atelier Touché gelled together over their love for
fine fashion and decided to launch their label Touché which retailed exclusively at PR.
Following the success of their numerous collections at PR, Heidy and Catherine took the
plunge and opened their own store, L’ Atelier Touché which now sees a steady stream of
customers drawn to their high-end clothing collections that are chic and minimal, based on
their own sense of style which is simply tres chic! What made you set up a fashion
business ? We share a common love for fashion in addition to having a very similar taste
for fashion too. We wanted to create timeless and stylish garments for which we felt there
was a niche. What is your background in fashion? Catherine: Neither of us come from a
fashion background. We both had a love for fashion and a taste for fine things since the
time we were very young. While I was at university I worked for a few years for Burberry
and a few other luxury fashion brands in Paris. Heidy: I worked in Marketing for Philip
Morris and also in sales at Prada, in addition to working in my family owned garment
business. How have you managed to find the right balance to cater to a Sri Lankan and
foreign clientele? We are fortunate that our clientele is composed equally of both Sri
Lankans and foreigners. The one trait these women share in common is their taste for
refinement that has evolved over the years. We find that increasingly a number of Sri
Lankan women dress not to impress but for comfort and timeless style, to be what we call
simply chic. That is why we believe they come to us. You only use plain colours , why
don’t you use prints? Our signature has always been minimalist designs with a sexy edge
revealed through a palette of monochromes that correspond to the image of our brand.
However , from time to time we do use some exclusive prints especially in our Maré
Tropical lines. Because of the rarity of the use of prints on our collections and the
limited edition of the styles produced, these pieces are very exclusive and timeless. They
are always the first to be sold out in our boutique and we want to keep them as exclusive
as possible. What is your brand philosophy? To create an elaborate wardrobe composed of
purity and minimalism, yet also intricate and sophisticated to achieve the perfect
timeless rock-chic European look. Who are the designers that influence your style ethos?
Stella Mccartney, Victoria Beckham, Valentino, Armani for the clean cuts of the styles and
of course Karl Lagerfeld. When creating collections what are you inspired by? Behind each
collection, there is always a serious amount of research, hard work, stress and
dedication. We don’t follow specific trends but instead, we evaluate them based on what we
like and what we would wear ourselves and what would suit our clientele. We create a mood
board depending on our inspiration of the moment. We are also influenced by our travel to
various countries. We are also lucky to live in an incredible country which is very
inspiring in terms of people, colours and textures which have often inspired us. When we
are designing a collection we often go for silhouettes that are simple, timeless, elegant
and minimal with a dash of rock! Photos: Tristan Laurens Bernard Tina Edward Gunawardhana

life_fashion90_10_Payal_Pratap_To_Showcase_At_PR_Sri_Lanka.pdf,"Payal Pratap To Showcase At PR Sri Lanka
May 25 2017. Payal Pratap, a senior designer of Indian origin will showcase her designs at
PR today. Having been in the industry for six years, Payal launched her label 'Payal
Pratap' back in 2010. Her label is dedicated for the modern Indian woman, who is
independent and rooted in tradition at the same time. Speaking to Life Online, Payal
shared her views about her label, inspirations and what she feels about showcasing her
designs in Sri Lanka. Can you tell us about your label and its USP? (Can you please
elaborate on any ethical associations, techniques used, artisans, etc.) Payal Pratap is an
urban brand with Indian roots reflective of the emancipation of the modern Indian woman.
It is contemporary while joyfully celebrating local crafts and hand embroideries. The
brand works with weavers, embroiderers, hand and digital printers and focuses on natural
fabrics. The USP of the brand is its folkloric adaptation of old techniques into a modern
avatar. The detailing and silhouettes are derived from rural costumes and ancient
traditional attire. Can you tell us about your design aesthetic? An organic feel, a
certain purity, yet replete with complex techniques that harness a basket of details. A
focus on easy going comfort, yet each piece is strong and unique in silhouette and
technique. Where do you draw inspiration from? From my grandmother's closet, to my
travels, to the environment, an area or a region, old costumes, it really could be
anything. There is no set formula and this is constantly evolving. What elements define
modern Indian fashion today? With so much awareness and with the internet shrinking global
distances, there is so much available and it is ever so important today for a designer to
have an original voice and their own take on what is fashion. At least the Indian consumer
is retracing history and learning to once again appreciate their craft and embrace their
culture in a modern sense. What pieces / staples from your collection are your favourites?
I love the saree dress. So special and unique and so easy to wear. Makes such a strong
statement too. Your husband is also a well-known Indian designer.How did you become a
designer and is it difficult to have two labels in one family? Rajesh and I were
classmates in design school and I worked with him for over a decade before starting my
line of clothing. I guess I just felt ready at some point to express myself and find my
own space. Difficult to have two labels in the family - yes and no. It is great to have a
sounding board like Rajesh with me and vice versa for him. However, of course the
pressures of our work obviously tend to take their toll. I wouldn't have it any other way!
What stores do you retail in internationally? Beams in Tokyo, Sauce in Dubai,
Anthropologie in the USA and UK, Lilies in Jeddah and Dubai, Dottis in Switzerland among
others. Can you name some famous Indians who wear your label? Sonam Kapoor, and she's ever
so elegant. How do you feel about exhibiting in Sri Lanka at a store like PR? This is my
first exhibition in PR with my complete Summer 2017 collection and I am excited to be
here. PR is a very stylish space and Annika takes personal care and is so very particular
about every little detail and I am happy to be retailing with her at PR. Are you excited
about being in Sri Lanka? Yes, as a matter of fact I've been wanting to visit Sri Lanka
and I'm sure I will take time out to discover Colombo and it's very special people. Your

life_fashion90_10_Swim_Week_Colombo_2018_Meet_The_Designers.pdf,"Swim Week Colombo 2018: Meet The Designers
Jun 28 2017. Swim Week Colombo 2018 begins! On the 30th of June and 1st of July, 13
designers will take to the ramp to present their resort, swim and active wear for the
season under this year's theme 'Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive'. Partnering with Swim
Week Colombo, we put the spotlight on designer brands, as they give us the inside info on
their new collections. A bold, vibrant and exotic resort wear brand, Rum Punch was
launched in 2015 by Rukshika Fernando, a graduate of AOD and Northumbria University.
Mixing bold designs and vivacious colours, the swimwear is best defined as contemporary
and classically feminine. Describe your swimwear collection in three words. Summer, fun
and festive. What were your design references? Travel and events like festivals and
concerts. Were there any elements that you became obsessed with while creating this
collection? I actually became obsessed with the prints that I created for the new range.
Where does your love for swimwear come from? My love for the ocean. What is the first
thing you do when designing a collection? Find some songs and images that lend some
inspiration to the concept or the mood of the range. Are there any parts of the world that
inspire your collection? Like I said, since festivals and concerts played a part in my
design I'm influenced by all the festivals from around the world. What are your thoughts
on sustainability in fashion? The fashion industry is the second biggest industry in the
world; therefore we as fashion designers have a great responsibility to protect the
environment. However it is not easy to do this on our own and I am happy to see that Swim
Week Colombo has taken a step in the right direction with their ""Green Conscience""
initiative. Rum Punch as a brand supports this initiative and we look forward to working
with SWC team to understand how we can make a positive contribution. What are you most
looking forward to at Swim Week Colombo 2018? I'm looking forward to showcasing the
festival range on the runway. How is Rum Punch 'Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive'? ·
Uses fabric packaging bags · Packaging materials is made in small local communities
contributing to community upliftment The label MAUS was created in 2013 by Annika Fernando
as a ladieswear brand designed and produced in Sri Lanka. MAUS presents three collections
each year, Summer, Monsoon and Fête complementing the tropical lifestyle in Sri Lanka.
Describe your swimwear collection in three words. Simple. Comfortable. Flattering. What
were your design references? The first collection for MAUS Swim was a collection of 6 main
classic silhouettes in 4 neutral colours. The new collection is impressing upon the first,
with new detail and design interest but not veering from MAUS' brand ethos of being clean,
essential and versatile. Were there any elements that you became obsessed with while
creating this collection? Not really. I did however intentionally want to create a little
more drama which I think will come through with a punch of colour in the new collection,
the limited edition resort wear (created in collaboration with designer, Sonali
Dharmawardena), new footwear and accessories. The drama however, is not intended to
detract from MAUS' intended core of simplicity. Where does your love for swimwear come
from? From a love of the water; I am a Piscean after all. And also for a love of basics,
of which one is swimwear, being that we live on an island. What is the first thing you do
when designing a collection? I remain that I am no fashion designer. I am a fashion
entrepreneur and play more with styling. New collections of course, stem from some
inspiration, sometimes just instinctive, sometimes more obvious. The details however, are
based on customer response to previous collections from my retail experience; what the
consumer wants, wishes for and of course, what I personally look for in particular items
of clothing and accessories. Are there any parts of the world that inspire your
collection? I would say people are more of an inspiration than places, but of course, Sri
Lanka is always the biggest part of the story. What are your thoughts on sustainability in
fashion? It is simply our social responsibility to one another, although it can often justbe a marketing gimmick. All MAUS clothing is manufactured in 'Garments Without Guilt'
factories like most local labels. It's something 'Made in Sri Lanka' is appreciated for
internationally. We also have MAUS Organic which is a range of 100% organic naturally dyed
cotton clothing. What are you looking forward to most at Swim Week Colombo 2018? I'm
looking forward to revealing the new collection in an exciting venue for the second
edition of Swim Week, which I know will just be an even better show. The experience behind
the organizers proves it, so it's just exciting for MAUS to just play a part. Seeing the
new direction and emphasis of the event also allows our local brands to be a part of
something so much bigger. How is MAUS 'Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive'? · Uses 100%
organic cotton and natural dyes throughout the overall MAUS brand · Using biodegradable
packaging for the new collection Celebrating the woman who stands out in a crowd, KOCA is
a label for those on the lookout for effortless style and elegance. Under the title
'KOCABRYN' designer duo sisters Najila and Rusila have extended their repertoire to
include swimwear under their label KOCA. Describe your swimwear collection in three words.
Funky, current, cool. What were your design references? Design inspirations were referred

the first thing you do when designing a collection? Reflect on the purpose of the brand

for years to come. Spa Ceylon Presenting their collection at Swim Week Colombo 2018, Spa

sustainability in fashion? Sustainability should be at the core of any industry. People

back to the environment as much as it takes and more. What are you looking forward to most
at Swim Week Colombo 2018? We look forward to showcasing the Tropical by Spa Ceylon
collection to an international audience, and showcasing the beauty and vibrancy of
Ceylonese art. Dinushi Pamunuwa is the designer behind the brand La Pard. Starting off her

Youthful styles is what we are expecting from her at Swim Week Colombo 2018. Describe your
swimwear collection in three words. Classy, Feminine, Sensitive. What were your design
references? My main surface inspiration was stars. The batik patterns derived from looking
at different constellations and stars in general. Were there any elements that you became
obsessed with while creating this collection? Colours. I have three accent colours and I
did some developments in order to achieve those colours the way I want as it can be rather
unpredictable with batik and the current weather. Synthetic material. I have minimised the
use of synthetic material through fabric and accessories. Where does your love for
swimwear come from? We are a beautiful island surrounded by the ocean. The beach brings a
sense of relaxation for me. Growing up, swimwear was always the printed synthetic material
that you come across everywhere, but to be able to change that to a more breathable and
natural fabric coupled with our traditional batik is where the swimwear collections get me
excited every single time. I am always excited to be able to infuse my favourite craft
into swimwear to create something unique and not adhere to fast fashion. What is the first
thing you do when designing a collection? I generally don't have a phase where I sit and
design for a particular collection. Once a collection I am working on has moved ontoproduction my mind is constantly open to different ideas and new inspiration and design.
There are several different elements I will be pondering on during this time. When I am to
design and come up with a collection I will pick my favourite that I feel the strongest
and continue on that path. Are there any parts of the world that inspire your collection?
Asian women. We are not as outspoken and confident of our bodies as the Western women are.
I want to be able to create swimwear that bridges the gap from practical to flattering.
The collection creates a variation for not only the petite woman with the curvy figure but
also for the plus size woman to be able to appreciate her body and swimwear. What are your
thoughts on sustainability in fashion? It is vital that we think sustainable in the
slightest way possible. Even the smallest act if we start practising it that will have a
positive impact in the long run. As a brand I try my best to stay away Living in the hills
of Kandy, designer Peronie Stefel has her new swim collection carefully under wraps! This
designer is noted for her use of batik coupled with simple silhouettes. This is her maiden
swim collection which has been inspired by intricate mandalas. Peronie is a talented
designer having won the Colombo Fashion Week Bright Sparks award a few years ago and we
can't wait for her to reveal her maiden swimwear collection. Describe your swimwear
collection in three words. Vivid, Neoteric, Bohemian. What were your design references? I
started working on this collection at a time where I was discovering my centre. I always
drew intricate mandalas as a form of meditation that's where I felt the urge to use the
circular shape as the foundation of my collection to portray the notion of infinity,
reoccurrence, and repetition. Mandalas - which represent the cycle of life and the
universe is a key reference. Motifs of Kandyan Buddhist art - the lotus flower, embekke
wood carvings, Dalada Maligawa Were there any elements that you became obsessed with while
creating this collection? The colour combination of teal, mint green, turquoise and ochre.
What is the first thing you do when designing a collection? For me, it's important to be
fully immersed in my key inspiration. I start with a mood board and colour story and
straight into my print designs. Are there any parts of the world that inspire your
collection? Travel inspires all my collection unconsciously always. This time though I
have been inspired by my hometown Kandy more than ever. Lot of inspiration has been drawn
by the rich art history to the quiet stillness my town offers where life slows down in
pace. What are your thoughts on sustainability in fashion? Unfortunately, the fashion
industry I too am a part of is one of the most polluting industries in the world. A major
contributor to global warming which is real, happening right now and hard to ignore. As a
designer and consumer it's a responsibility to be aware of ways to improve and reduce our
carbon footprint as much as possible. A good start I believe is by making simple
decisions. Like buying local products, better quality fewer items and shifting away from
disposable fashion. What are you most looking forward to at Swim Week Colombo 2018? This
project has been a very special experience for me. Honouring the local craft batik I
embrace as a designer, this project allowed me to approach my aesthetic through digital
printing and high tech manufacturing. The process has been successful in terms of
eliminating wastage of water involved in batik craft, durability of the product but also
in line with the craft and identity of my brand. So most I would say is to witness my
debut swimwear collection on ramp also excited to see the collections of all the other
very talent local designers and of course the set up of the venue this season. Sharmila
Ruberu the designer behind the label Meraki is a versatile designer than can create
evening wear and swimwear with equal aplomb. Never one to shy away from being bold, her
designs are daring but sophisticated. Sharmilla is a perfectionist and puts a lot of
thought into her designs which is evident in her creations. Describe your swimwear
collection in three words. Intense confidence feminised. What were your design references?
Strength of the woman of today. Were there any elements that you became obsessed with
while creating this collection? Nature and environment hence a colour palette incoordination with it. Where does your love for swimwear come from? To be honest from a
place where I never knew it existed to begin with, until I was thrown in to the deep end.
What is the first thing you do when designing a collection? Once a seed of an idea gets in
I just immerse myself in it and let it flow. Are there any parts of the world that inspire
your collection? It's not just one part but a global thing. What are your thoughts on
sustainability in fashion? It is the need of the hour and we all need to stand as one to
make the difference. What are you looking forward to most at Swim Week Colombo 2018? The
adrenaline rush and mostly being able to be a part of the awe-inspiring theme beginning
this season 'Green Conscious Earth Sensitive'. A brand offering cool and contemporary
swimwear designs, Conscience will present its maiden swim collection at Swim Week Colombo
2018. Describe your swimwear collection in three words. Pushing simplicity further. What
were your design references? I introduced the shapes of some English alphabets to the
deisgn philosophy of Conscience while creating this collection. It was the first swimwear
collection by Conscience. We had to have some fun! Were there any elements that you became
obsessed with while creating this collection? Conscience is a part of the evolving project
called Making of a Perfect Green Bikini. This was interesting as we were thinking of what
can be done so that evert aspect of the process is impacted. Where does your love for
swimwear come from? From water, and then nature. There is amazing connection there. What
is the first thing you do when designing a collection? Look for an idea hook. It's the
magic ones that come, and everything just falls in place. Are there any parts of the world
that inspire your collection? Being the first Conscience collection, I wanted to push the
envelope by using shapes of some alphabets and experiment with the silhouettes using the
said shapes. What are your thoughts on sustainability in fashion? Conscience as a brand
stands on 'Good Fashion' philosophy. It is a must. It should be a normal way opertaing.
What are you most looking forward to at Swim Week Colombo 2018? The new positioning that
every participating designer will have a green impact story is exciting. As it is like
stepping into a new new which is good and meets our thinking. One of Sri Lanka's original
homegrown swim and beach wear brands, Arugam Bay is full of life and vitality. Colours and
prints are set to dominate this eagerly awaited collection. Describe your swimwear
collection in three words. What were your design references? We had fun using an Aztec
print made out of small flipflops, using the colour chaos of Arugam Bay. The classic
silhouettes were used with bold prints representing Arugam Bay's take on nature. Were
there any elements that you became obsessed with while creating this collection? Humour
and environment were the elements we worked on actively introducing to the design DNA, and
this was kept within the marine colour story. Where does your love for swimwear come from?
The brand is inherently immersed in surf and beach culture. The little town of Arugam Bay
has provided the inspiration which we have mystically expanded further. What is the first
thing you do when designing a collection? Look for a deeper meaning of a colour that has
caught my eye, and start weaving an idea story from there. As colour is such an important
part of Arugam Bay, it remains intrinsic to it. Are there any parts of the world that
inspire your collection? More than any part of the world, a combination of surf + beach +
island becomes the inspiration for any collections. We also visit the mystical story of
Arugam Bay which is weaved in the brand DNA for inspiration. What are your thoughts on
sustainability in fashion? Arugam Bay is actively involved in a quantifiable PET bottle
recycle project. Each pair of Arugam Bay shorts are made from 7 PET bottles. To me, that
is so important. We are pushing it beyond shorts to our other products. What are you most
looking forward to at Swim Week Colombo 2018? Every fashion week raises the bar of fashion
quotient, deisgn, show production, and overall fashion environment, within that it is
exciting for Arugam Bay to push the boundary as well. It's a good fraternity feeling. Ajay
Kumar Flamboyant, bold and eclectic are the key words behind Ajay Kumar's collection.
Taking part in his first international fashion show here in Sri Lanka, Ajay Kumar iseagerly awaiting to unveil his new collections which promises to be awe-inspiring.
Describe your swimwear collection in 3 words. We are presenting our resort line. Three
words that would describe our collection - bold, flamboyant and eclectic. What were your
design references? All our designs are influenced from Indian heritage, art, architecture,
landscape and motifs yet very contemporary in outlook. Each piece is iconic and has a
story to tell. The resort line also has elements from our inspiration but handcrafted to
look very stylish and resortish. Were there any elements that you became obsessed with
while creating this collection? Yes, we became obsessed with the lotus. It is omnipresent
across all our products and throws light on this existing symbolism of 'The Lotus Flower'
in context to the duality of human nature. The lotus has been visualised in floral and
geometric forms - or as we call florogeometric patterns to render a nouveau touch. Where
does your love for swimwear come from? We have designed a resort line and we feel it is a
stylish extension of our existing line. What is the first thing you do when designing a
collection? First thing that comes to mind while designing a collection is 'The Emotional
Connect'. What am I trying to do here and why? What can I connect the inspirations and
trends to - the threads of consciousness that connects everything together. Are there any
parts of the world that inspire your collection? India. We are an Indian brand and we have
vast resources of textile heritage and culture to be inspired from. Other than India,
Florence and London are two places that inspire me the most. What are your thoughts on
sustainability in fashion? Sustainability is present in every aspect of our business of
fashion. On the consumer's side, reducing impulse buying and investing in good quality
pieces is a step towards sustainability. This would slow down consumption and reduce the
impact on the environment. Save your dad's vintage jacket and reuse them or wearing family
heirlooms creates sustainable fashion. As a brand, we make engineered prints and make
bespoke garments, thus, reducing fabric consumption.We are taking slow and steady steps to
empower every individual and community working with us and creating value in the chain.
The journey has just begun towards becoming a sustainable and conscious luxury brand with
a brand ethos that works towards being responsible, transparent, modern, fair and
environmentally conscious in many ways. We are not perfect and we may never be but we are
trying and in many ways contributing back to the society. What are you most looking
forward to at Swim Week Colombo 2018? Well, Sri Lanka and India are similar in many ways,
we share the same cultural threads, food habits and it doesn't feel that you are going to
showcase in a new country. You feel at home. I am extremely excited as this is my first
international show in Colombo. Aqua Island Another home grown Sri Lankan swim wear design
brand Aqua Island's collection is best described as athleisure at best. Describe your
swimwear collection in three words. Tropical, Sustainable, Athleisure. What were your
design references? Active swim range - tropical motifs, summer vibes and silhouettes
inspired by athleisure wear Eco range - sustainability (recycled fabrics), feminine
effects and unconventional silhouettes Fashion range - Renaissance period Were there any
elements that you became obsessed with while creating this collection? Trying to achieve
the right combination of athletics and leisure into swimwear. Sourcing for recycled raw
material to facilitate the process of manufacturing and taking every effort to make it
feasible. Use of various types of embellishments to enhance the collection. What is the
first thing you do when designing a collection? We start with market research and
reviewing current trends. Secondly we come up with a concept for colors, silhouettes and
prints that goes parallel with our research. And beginning the process of refining and
revising the collections to match our target audience. Are there any parts of the world
that inspire your collection? Amalgamation of Sri Lanka and a few islands across the
world. What are your thoughts on sustainability in fashion? The knowledge and act of
sustainability lies within us; it is not something that you can force to stabilize. It is
a creativity of your own, a stand, a principle that you take with an admiration andpassion to sustain the earth for the benefit of the people, economy and most importantly
the environment. We as a brand identify very much with the growing philosophy of green
fashion. Our dedicated eco ranges are our commitment to the journey of sustainable
fashion. And is only the beginning. Sustainability is one of the pillars the brand is
being built on and we will be working towards achieving the highest potential of going
green in every aspect of our supply chain. We want to give all the swim lovers something
fashionable first which will draw them to consume ethical swimwear. And to maintain
interaction with them creating a sustainably aware customer portfolio. Rather than just
retailing products. We want them to join us in this journey. It's very important as a
nation to understand why this is needed and what we can do to change the norms. What are
you most looking forward to at Swim Week Colombo 2018? We are excited to witness the new
trends that the swim week will showcase and where each trend is inspired from. TEXT by

Apr 01 2019. Discovering a niche in the sleepwear market, designer Thisakya Senanayake
Wijeyaratne was inspired to start her uniquely named brand, The Moon and All Its Stars
which she unveiled over the weekend at The Design Collective. The sleepwear collection
ranges from pajama sets to cute little shorts that look very comfortable. Also included
were robes in the softest of silk fabrics. Judging by Thisakya’s collection it is evident
that she has given equal emphasis to comfort and look. Her prints were delicate and the
colour palette in neutrals showed that she has put a lot of thought in to her maiden
collection. Perfect as both sleepwear and loungewear the collection is stylish and
comfortable. She has used locally sourced fabrics and production houses to create this
range which can also be personalized. Thisakya is a graduate of Central Saint Martins and
The London College of Fashion and has worked in London and New York before returning to
Sri Lanka to start her own business. She has used her experience to create a brand with
nuances of luxury at very affordable price points. The Moon and All Its Stars will

Nov 14 2022. Today I speak to Indi Yapa Abeywardena about what she is hoping to add to the
runway on the 18th of November 2022. The show is set to be very interesting and I wanted
to speak to her about her inspiration and what makes this show special. What can we expect
on the show as it’s also a celebration of 10 years in the industry? You will see good
fashion and along with the designs, we hope to add diversity, history, and culture. ‘Aarya
by Indi’ Spring and Summer 2023 fashion show is set to be at the Colombo Town Hall
Building. The collection was named Aarya after my niece, and the historical significance
behind the word is a reference to goddesses Parvati and Durga, translating to the noble
lady. You said there is a story with the collection. Yes, “The show will be an
amalgamation of storytelling, textiles, and history. The Aarya collection embodies a sense
of heritage and is heavily inspired by the ancient paintings and architecture of Sri
Lanka. I would describe it as a translation of the past to the present.” Tell me about the
collection. The Aarya collection is set to feature hand-drawn prints, powerful statement
pieces, inclusive outfits, and meticulously handcrafted textures that the brand Indi is
known for. The collection has over 50 styles, ranging from bridal and ethnic wear to
western wear like dresses, gowns, jumpsuits, blouses, and sarees. Focusing on
sustainability, the collection consists of detachable pieces and silhouettes designed to
be deconstructed and worn as separates, prolonging the lifespan of these garments. Would
you be featuring any other designers? No, this one is all me. As the designer, I'm
honoured and excited to put together a fashion show of this grandeur my all ladies and the
one-man team at House of Indi is working hard day and night to bring out a collection that
you will enjoy Where do you feel fashion is heading in Sri Lanka? Fashion has witnessed a
massive transition, from embracing cultures to empowering traditions. Inspiration is
everywhere – in nature, architecture, people going about their lives, a piece of art, an
intricately decorated home, and my travels across our country. You are working with crafts
from across the country tell me about it. I really do believe in supporting women, by
supporting them with the aim of transforming them into stronger individuals. I use my
skills as an entrepreneur to advocate for higher causes through my passion for art,
history, and social justice. In doing so, I redefined what being a designer could
represent, inspiring a wave of young and emerging designers to use fashion as a means of
sparkling cultural change. During these tough times, was getting sponsors hard? Tell me
who is on the show with you. I have some amazing people like Christell Skin Clinic,
Cinnamon Grand Colombo and Cinnamon Lakeside, Aroma Bliss Ceylon, Sri Lankan Airlines, BK
Academy Capello Salons, Beyond Destiny, Nierra Shoes, Gitano Collection and Lè Fleuristè &
Wine World. I’m touched by their support, I know how tuff these few days have been. How

life_fashion90_11_CFW_2019_-_Day_4.pdf,"CFW 2019 - Day 4
Mar 03 2019. HSBC Colombo Fashion Week drew to a close on the 4th and final day which was
held at the poolside of the Colombo Hilton in a specially constructed marquee. The show
started with an explosion of colour by the uber talented Sonali Dharmawardene who yet
again unleashed her artistic genius by way of her batik creations. Following closely were
Charini Suriyage and Indi Yapa Abeywardene who showcased sleek collections which had great
commercial appeal. For the men, Fouzul Hameed lead the way with his collection of sharp
suits while Lovi Ceylon presented clothing for both men and women. The finale was provided
by Indian designer Rajesh Pratap Singh who presented a collection of ethnic outfits which
aptly demonstrated his design genius and confirmed his position as one of India’s most
sought after designers. Lovi Ceylon With an aptly named collection called Rise, designer
Asanka de Mel has risen to the challenge to elevate the sarong to the next level in the
fashion stratosphere. He has taken the humble sarong and made this a high fashion garment.
Rise, sees the introduction of smart jackets in luxe velvet fabrics which are paired with
handloom and silk sarongs. Rise also sees the launch of a special collection of Lovi
footwear. A total makeover for the sarong which now has an international appeal. Fouzul
Hameed Enjoying his prime position as Sri Lanka's sharpest tailor, Hameed continues to
dazzle with his sheer workmanship. Inspired largely by his global travels Hameed hankers
after the suave sophistication of the Italian man which he attempts to translate into his
creations. While concentrating on black, his colour of choice for the season, Hameed shows
his adventurous streak with the use of printed fabric in a few pieces which is a departure
from his norm. His ceremonial suits were sharp and stylish and it is no wonder why the
city’s contingent of fashionable men turn to Fouzul Hameed. Sonali Dharmawardena An
inspiring union of colour, prints and silhouettes gave birth to a fabulous collection by
Sonali. The runway had a feminine vibe from start to finish. Her clothes conveyed an
elegance with details helping to boost the ‘Sonali’ style identity. The artist within her
comes to the fore each time she shows at fashion week and this time it was no exception.
From saris and dresses to pants and gowns, this collection ticked the boxes for
creativity, originality, and scalability. Walking works of art, each piece is oh so
beautiful! Indi Yapa Abeywardena The show was an upbeat blend of blue, white and red with
fascinating modern graphic prints of motifs complemented by a sophisticated blend of
dresses, pants and saris. Her clever juxtaposition of prints and colour added an
interesting dimension to her collection. Intricate beadwork on some of the clothes
reflected Indi’s love for bling in the most subtle form. Her collection had a great
commercial appeal as the colours and silhouettes worked well together. Charini Suriyage
Drawing inspiration from the wildlife in Sri Lanka we saw several reptilian prints and
abstract floral prints dominate this collection. Continually experimenting with new
silhouettes, this collection saw Charini pushing the boundaries further by creating form-
fitting dresses. Dresses slit to the thigh along with necklines to reveal décolletage in
the most tasteful way added an element of dare to the collection. Ruffles and frills were
also a notable feature in her collection. Rajesh Pratap Singh An apt finale for Fashion
Week, Rajesh Pratap Singh presented a swoonworthy collection of ethnic outfits. Singh
opened the show with soft shades of white and off white and then created a momentum by
adding richer colours of dull gold until the finale which ended in a crescendo of red and
glimmering gold. Some of his fabrics were reminiscent of William Morris’s prints, with
delicate motifs skilfully woven into the fabric to create a luxurious look especially with
the gold and red colour combinations. Jackets, tunics, coats, dhotis and dresses were
created exquisite and clearly demonstrated why Singh is considered a fashion genius in his
home country. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_11_Designer_1-2-1_Hashanthi_Madugalle.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Hashanthi Madugalle
Feb 23 2021. Self-taught designer Hashanthi Madugalle is the founder of her label Tales by
Tia. Launched in July 2016, Tales by Tia is a brand that started out small but has
progressed with great success. Hashanthi likes to keep her designs as unique as possible
while understanding that comfort is of importance to her clientele. Name of the brand?
Tales by Tia When did you launch your brand? July 2016 What sparked your interest in
fashion design? Ever since I was a kid I loved dressing up others. Not so much my self but
others! I used to have a ‘don’t care what I wear’ attitude but would say I have always had
an eye for fashion. What made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it?
I have always had a creative side in me and I thought this is something I can do and be
happy and content with. Also, at the same time, I saw a need for affordable clothing which
are not mass-produced and saw an opportunity there. I try my best to keep my designs as
unique as possible and only make very few pieces from each design. I would say that the
interest in starting something of my own and my fondness for fashion made me do this. It’s
more of a hobby to be honest. Are you self taught or did you study fashion design? I am
self-taught. My field of study is Psychology and International Relations. How has your
work evolved since you began your own label? I started off not knowing even the basics of
running a business. My then-boyfriend (now husband) pushed me to make this happen and was
guiding me every step of the way in terms of running the business and making a brand out
of it. Started very small with the support of my close friends and family and I like to
think that we are a few steps ahead from where we were. I wanted my brand ‘Tales by Tia’
to be known and I believe we are slowly getting there. Began with a few casual pieces and
now we have expanded to custom wear including bridesmaid’s outfits. Are there any types of
clothing that you avoid designing? Anything that may be uncomfortable. I make it a point
to handpick fabrics and ensure that it feels good to wear them. Where do you look for
creative inspiration? To be honest, the most random things! Describe your latest
collection? Like I said, my top-most priority is unique and comfortable clothing and this
is something I apply to all my collections. My latest collection is called ‘Classics with
a Twist’ and I have done a few classic pieces with a little twist to them. Who is your
muse? Anyone with good taste! What are your sustainability credentials? We make sure that
everyone in our supply chain is paid fairly and are not exploited. We firmly focus on
quality over quantity with a minimum impact on the environment. What are you fascinated by
at the moment and how does it feed into your work? Right now, I am fascinated with dying
trends and my latest upcoming project is based on that. Stay tuned! What is the biggest
lesson that you have learned since you started your company? Hard work is key amidst
everything else. What’s your motto? Keep up with change. Work with Integrity - Always
Which international or local designers are you inspired by? For international designers, I
would say the likes of Stella McCartney and Marc Jacobs. As for local designers, I love
Aslam Hussein’s work. What role do you think social media plays in fashion today? Having a
good social media platform is essential in this fast-moving industry to be competitive. I
think it plays a major role and when used in the proper way, opportunities are endless.
What is your favourite part about being a designer? I think I am more of an entrepreneur
than a designer although I love being creative and putting something unique out there. To
answer your question though, I love how rewarding it is to see other people in something I
made. How do you want women to feel when wearing your clothes? Confident and comfortable.

life_fashion90_11_Dhananjaya_Bandara_celebrates_25_years_of_creative_excellenc.pdf,"Dhananjaya Bandara celebrates 25 years of creative excellence
Jun 27 2025. By Kamanthi Wickramasinghe Pics by Waruna Wanniarachchi The halls of the
Grand Ballroom at Hilton Colombo came alive on Tuesday (24) with rich Sri Lankan music,
dance and fashion as Dhananjaya Bandara, expert bridal dresser, stylist, and hair and
makeup artist, celebrated 25 years of creating magic. As the founder and livewire behind
Dhananjaya Bandara Salons, Bandara is best known for his passion in creating timeless
elegance, celebrating individuality while blending tradition with innovation. The event
witnessed the launch of DB Ceylon, which stands as a tribute to Sri Lanka’s rich cultural
heritage. Rooted in the island’s artistry, this brand seeks to reimagine the essence of
Sri Lankan customs with a modern touch, preserving their beauty and yet crafting something
entirely new. The iconic swan symbol unveiled during the event indicates a big swan and a
small swan in a warm embrace. When questioned about the logo, he said that the big swan
indicates his mother and that the small swan is Dhananjaya himself. His mother, Rathna
Wijesinghe, has been a driving force along his journey, and Bandara takes pride in the
fact that his mother was there to support him every step of the way. The show was indeed a
spectacle unto itself as it showcased several unique collections of bridal wear, elegant
fashion and jewellery, further highlighting Bandara’s passion for styling and creating
magic. Veteran actress Sangeetha Weeraratne was an absolute show-stopper as she added
glamour to the opening act with timeless pieces of jewellery and a stunning saree. Curated
in different segments, the Bridal and Fashion Couture featured timeless pieces of
jewellery designed by Raja Jewellers, a unique collection of outfits by Lovi Ceylon and
some of the finest craftsmanship on various saree designs. What was unique about the
outfits was that they were hand-woven and designed especially for this showcase. The
Iconic Ladies’ segment was one of the highlights of the event, where many ladies
representing different fields walked the ramp. From former Mrs. World Rosy Senanayake to
Ramani Fernando, Shereen Kumaratunga, Sujeewa Nelson, Apsari Tillekeratne, to Caroline
Jurie walked the ramp in dazzling outfits and pieces of jewellery curated by Bandara
himself. Over 90 models walked the ramp during this extravagant showcase of fashion and
tradition. The show was choreographed by renowned fashion designer, choreographer and
trainer Lou Ching Wong. Bandara didn’t forget to pay floral tributes to his mother and
veteran designer, hair stylist and makeup artist Harris Wijesinghe. The outfits and
jewellery showcased at the event could be purchased at www.dbceylon.com A psychology

Mar 14 2018. Featuring - ChaThak On Fashionably Danu, I took to the messy streets of
Kochikade to check out ChaThak, a new and trending t-shirt brand which is making waves for
its very creative slogans.I love the fact that the prints have a local flavour . Also,it’s
the perfect weather to go all out with your T-shirts . Today I speak to the founder of
ChaThak on what makes his brand unique and a Sri Lankan favourite. 1. What is ChaThak
about? This brand reflects the minds of the young and young at heart. It's a splash of
thoughts splattered with our signature. 2. Tell me about your collection which you have
featured in this shoot? This collection reflects typical Sri Lankan style through funny
quotes of the two main local languages. 3. What would you say is missing in men’s casual
fashion in Sri Lanka? When comparing to other countries, I feel we miss variety in men's
casual fashion. I feel like most of the people in the fashion trade are playing it too
safe and I feel we are ready to challenge ourselves. As a clothing company , we will do
our best to give a good variety of clothing in the coming days! 4. As we come from a
tropical country, what do you keep in mind when you source your material? All our T-shirts
are 100% cotton. And we keep it affordable so we have more customers in the shop. 5. You
also had a collection of shirts, how was that and when would you bring it back? It was all
good in the beginning, later we lost our good fabric source and as I believe quality comes
first, so we have stooped it temporarily. 6. What are the most moving prints and what’s
the pulse in the market? We have a variety of crew neck tees! One of our key features is
the couple tees, family tees, swag tees, and psycho slogans. But our fast sellers are
couple T-shirts. 7. What is the process of making your design, your inspiration/idols
etc.? When it comes to designing we always try to grab the attention of the young and
trendy people out there. We want to see a sense of pride in wearing something local
and for me , the NIKE brand and logo are a great inspiration. They're simple but very
effective. 8. What are the best sellers, do the gentlemen of today like it simple or not,
and what is the most popular size? Big demands are for simple T-shirts. The most popular
size is medium around Colombo and in suburbs it is large! Designer – Shadheeshan

life_fashion90_11_Fashions_Enfant_Terrible_Andre_Estefan_delivers_a_fashion_pu.pdf,"Fashion’s Enfant Terrible Andre Estefan delivers a fashion punch!
Aug 21 2018. Breaking free from the shackles of oppression and relegating the notion of
colonial romanticism to the past was the strong message that emanated from the runway show
of Stefan Andre Joachim. This was a sleek and slick show held at Trace City to celebrate
Stefan’s thirty years in fashion. For Stefan, creativity is part of his DNA. From interior
and fashion design to creating concepts and creating ideas, creativity courses through his
veins. An outspoken personality, for Stefan this fashion show was the perfect platform to
express nay vent his annoyance on a range of topics that he feels betrays our inherent Sri
Lankan identity. The new enfant terrible of Sri Lankan fashion, Stefan’s clarion call is
decolonization and this was reflected in his collection. What’s the name of this
collection? “Colonial Romance” is a concept by Andre Estefan. The fashion aspect was just
one part of the creative expression. The rest of the year will see the unfolding of the
total concept by way of my personal journey through other forms of expression. How long
have you been a Designer for? In my head, it feels like a 1000 years but if I conform to
the norm it would be 30. I had my first show in 1988. What fabrics did you use? I used a
variation of fabrics because Sri Lanka has NO fabrics where you can decide and then shop.
The process is pretty primitive that way. You need to check on the availability first and
then look at what can be done. This show had had subliminal messages in each segment. What
were they? Haha. I don’t think I could ever be accused of this. I think the message was
very in your face and if you were even remotely blind or deaf that was taken care of in
how it was presented to you. The message of how we have embraced our colonial past and
forgotten what it means to own our own identity. The want to constantly look fair and
lovely even at the cost of losing your melanin and inviting death by skin cancer at the
age of 18. The discussion of “Ethical Fashion” (roll of eyes) by self-proclaimed fashion
experts when the beginning of all ethics should be how you treat your fellow humans by way
of a minimum wage. Ethics is something that doesn’t need to be taught to us by the west.
Especially, by the west. There is nothing to learn about ethics, you are either ethical or
not. I’m not a believer in holding hands and playing to the western gallery. Surely, we
don’t need to be told by “experts” that what we have done to our fellow countrymen is
wrong? Before we start spending money on technology to convert plastic bottles into
Kaftans or some equally irrational nonsense why don’t we pay our starving labour force
better? The very labour that keep some of the multi-millionaires of the garment trade in
their luxury houses, cars and clothing brands? Isn’t what’s happening here almost a form
of a repetition of our colonial past? It’s the same in the tea trade. We need to PAY the
backbone of the trade and treat them like fellow humans correctly first!! Poor Meen-Amma
has been plucking tea with no break from the time she was brought here by force from India
and made to live in the most appalling conditions for over the last 150 years! Why is it
so hard for these greedy businesses to see that they only continue in the same ways of the
imperialists? Why is it so hard to be able to see Meen-Amma’s children as our own? How
would any of us feel if our child had to live, eat, school and void our bowels in the same
deplorable conditions as Meen-Ammas family? What was the overall message you were trying
to communicate through your collection? DECOLONISE - DECOLONISE -DECOLONISE even now! Let
go of the rubbish we have been made to believe in! I am the last person who believes in a
blame game. What’s done is done and we need to move on. BUT it’s about the awareness we
need to create, the awareness of the damage it has created and the impact it continues to
have on our society today. Colonial Romance is about awareness, Colonial Romance is about
art with passion and a responsibility towards teaching the youth what once was. We can’t
do anything about the past but we can do something about the future. We chose to ignore to
date the way we as a country were treated. We chose to invite back the very oppressors,
the very colonizers to celebrate OUR day of independence in this country. What nonsense isthat? How long did you spend conceptualising this collection? Almost a lifetime I believe.
You have several irons in the fire. What are some of them? I prefer passions in the fire
Andre Estefan, Arq Style House, Flamingo House, the Love Bar and The Attic. Would you ever
consider a return to fashion? I think I have only just begun. What is your career path
henceforth? Historically, we are a creative nation. A country that had some of the most
amazing craft people. We have lost most of it because no government has truly invested in
keeping these crafts alive. I have always believed in the possibility of earning off our
creativity opposed to our labour. We still earn off our labour force, be it the women and
men n the garment trade or as domestic labour in the middle east. We can be better than
this BUT the country needs to invest in this path. I have many colleagues who through the
IT industry have invested personal money in order to create this opportunity for the
youth, but this is the job of any government of the day, and it needs to be an effort
agreed by all governing and those in opposition not to break this momentum for the greater
good of the country. It is the job of the government to ensure that every single one of
these companies have the required support in order to forge ahead at lightning speeds and
put a stop to all this union interference every time some rusty government train feels
threatened. On a personal note of my career path, I will put Andre Estefan on the fashion
map internationally, no matter what I do. As I am a Sri Lankan, I hope that helps the
country in some little way, but I wont hold my breath on that one. Photos: Manoj Ratnayake

life_fashion90_12_Buttoning_up_a_new_dress_with_Button_Masala.pdf,"Buttoning up a new dress with Button Masala
Aug 27 2018. It was a mixed bunch that gathered at the Design Collective on a Saturday
morning to see how Indian designer Anuj Sharma would create an item of clothing sans a
single stitch. Anuj Sharma is credited with being able to create exquisite clothing
without employing a needle and thread but simply by using buttons and rubberbands. Anuj
Sharma It was a great move by Shahili Gomes and Binu Wickramasinghe to bring down Sharma
(whose clothes retail at the Design Collective) to conduct this workshop as a celebration
of the first anniversary of the Design Collective which is fast gaining a reputation as a
fantastic place to shop. Sharma’s obsession with creating clothes with rubber bands and
buttons began when he spotted a man whose clothes were not buttoned properly. This made
him question the possibility of working with buttons using a simple grid system where
buttons were stitched on to fabric at a distance of two inches. The separate fabric straps
had buttonholes at the same distance as the buttons. He then used the straps to drape the
fabric into garments. This innovative collection which was showcased at Lakme Fashion Week
won him a legion of fans. Not content with that, Sharma continued to experiment and came
up with a new vision which created a new version of his original innovation. He replaced
the buttonholes with rubber bands. This eliminated the need for stitching. He also
discovered that if you inserted buttons into the fabric and affixed it with a rubber band
there was no need for any other machines or tools to create clothing. This lead him to
create further collections which caused a storm on the runway and earned him wide acclaim.
In Colombo for two days, Sharma conducted two workshops. Fashion designers, accessory
designers, and fashion students were eager to learn this new technique which is completely
unique to Sri Lanka. Sharma estimates to have taught his Button Masala technique to over
30,000 students around the world. He also reckons that the button masala technique is the
most popular technique after sewing and knitting. His personal ethic is “waste not want
not” and advocates that excesses harm the planet we live in. His workshop which was
conducted during a four hour session covered the history of Button Masala, a live
demonstration on the technique and an interactive session where the participants created a
garment with rubber bands, button and fabric. The workshop was fun and creative. The
participants were put through their paces when they had to think on their feet and drape
the two meters of fabric and use the buttons and rubber bands to create an item of
clothing. Some made jumpsuits, while the others made dresses. The creative energy was
palpable and each one thoroughly enjoyed their time at the workshop. How popular this
method will become in Sri Lanka remains to be seen, but it certainly seems a trend that
many people may cotton on to! Binu – Co-Founder of The Design Collective “ Anuj has been
retailing with us for a while and we thought it was a good idea to bring him down to
conduct a workshop as a celebration of our first anniversary. Rukshi – Founder of RumPunch
“As a designer I was keen to see this technique. I think it is a fab and fun way to create
something quirky” Suly – Co-Founder of Navya accessories “I might consider using this
technique to embellish some of the bags we create” Kate – Teacher AOD “This is a novel
technique I learnt today and it is easier than it looks” Photos by: Damith Wickramasinghe

Oct 25 2017. Today I’m happy to feature some young talent, hungry to bring something new
to you in Colombo. It started as a dream and today they have brought down the most
efficient machinery to make some high quality T-Shirts. Today we are highlighting the
Halloween collection, which only took a matter of minutes to come off the print straight
for the shoot. The founder speaks about, how anything and everything can be personalised
and I took some Halloween effects to make it special. What’s the thinking behind the name
AkiY? AkiY is all about Creating your Identity. A small initiative which began in 2015 in
a small area has now expanded to three stores located in Bambalapitiya. Tell me about the
process in designing a t-shirt? And how long does it take? Our marketing team will do a
research on new concepts and current trends, then our designing team will come up with
fascinating designs. If the customers are comfortable with the design then our production
team will print within 20 minutes with no compromises in quality. Tell me about your
branch in Jaffna? And how is business there? AkiY was initiated first in Jaffna. Jaffna is
the city with many corporate, government and non-government sectors. Akiy in Jaffna covers
all the corporates, schools, government sectors, clubs, shops etc. We mainly focus on the
manufacture of the best corporate T-shirts in Jaffna. This was initiated 2 years ago and
is still running successfully. In what country does this style of prints do well? United
States of America is the best in printing t-shirts. They have a mass production of
t-shirts with best quality around the world. As a brand, how many designs do you introduce
in a collection? How many for this Halloween? We introduce at least 10 t-shirts in a
collection, For the Halloween we designed different choices based on current trends. Can
you also customise designs on request? Yes, We can do any design at any time ! Is there an
online platform to make an order? Yes, We are in the process of launching a new site where
you can design your own Tshirt, you can place the order and get it printed. What is the
process of creating and marketing your design? You design inspiration. Customer
satisfaction is our inspiration and we are branding our Tees with best price and best
quality on time. What would you say are the biggest selling designs? Inspirational quotes,
sarcasm, peace bro, Mersal and jimiki kammal are the most selling designs. What's the cost
for a piece? And what's next for the brand? Prices are starting from Rs 990 onwards. It
depends on the design and material. More over customers can customise their designs with
the cost which starts from Rs 850. We are managing to tie up the costs with other outlets.

life_fashion90_12_Fashionably_Danu_La_Ceyloné.pdf,"Fashionably Danu: La Ceyloné
May 19 2020. Today on Fashionably Danu, I feature one of my favourite Lankan brands, La
Ceyloné, and their cool new masks. When COVID19 lockdown just started, La Ceyloné started
working on masks with a funky outlook to it, and it’s great to see it in the market
today... A set of 5 for LKR 2500. These re-usable masks are comfortable to wear and can be
washed. Let’s make the new “normal” Fashionable. LA CEYLONÉ POSTED A MASK IMAGE JUST AFTER
LOCKDOWN - WHAT MADE YOU GUYS WORK ON IT SO SOON? We posted an image of a working sample
of a mask in late March, where the current pandemic was in a rising stage in Sri Lanka.
However, the majority of our global franchises knew from January onwards that it will come
to a point where everyone will need protective masks. It was under that demand that we
started testing different thicknesses, sizes, and patterns for our face masks. Keeping in
mind that we could add our own touch of colour and prints to raise positivity into the
lives of those who have chosen our brand. Q WHEN YOU PICK FABRIC, WHAT DO YOU LOOK FOR? La
Ceyloné has always been the pioneer of bringing bright, bold prints to the market under
our savvy resort wear collection since December 2018. Comfort and durability are our main
focus when picking fabrics, which have a natural dye-composition. In simple, high-quality
fabrics with similarly dense dyes for a feather-light touch, with colour mismatching to
suit any occasion. Another important factor we strive to uphold is to keep our products as
eco-friendly as we possibly can. Q HOW DARING DO YOU THINK MEN AND WOMEN ARE IN FASHION
TODAY; WOULD THEY PULL OFF A FLASHY MASK WITH COVID? We think bold statements through
clothes which people have worn, time and time again has proven to help create and showcase
different identities and personalities. Since the launch of our brand, men, much like
women, expressed their bolder, brighter side through our products. We have no doubt that
people would want to brighten up their day (given the current times) by adding a subtle
touch of colour to a now essential item like a face mask. Q AS A BRAND HOW MANY PIECES DO
YOU INTRODUCE IN ONE COLLECTION AND HOW WOULD IT WORK IN THE FUTURE? To keep our print
lines fresh, we add new prints every month. As of now, that collection varies between
10-30 prints per collection. Some exclusive prints go out to our global shops. In the
future, we plan to introduce much more than our classic collections, by introducing to our
customers, a premium range, and limited edition prints, as well as customizable prints for
our more exclusive fans. Q TELL ME ABOUT YOUR MASKS; WHAT HAVE YOU GUYS KEPT IN MIND WHEN
CREATING IT? While maintaining the basic standard of a face mask, we wanted it to be
comfortable, breathable, as well as re-usable. We have added dense-fusing to the middle,
but one that will not make the mask too heavy for your face. Of course, the florals and
prints make them that much more special! Q FLORAL SHIRTS ARE A BIG DEAL, WHAT ARE YOUR
BIGGEST SELLING PRINTS? THERE’S ALSO A CLUTTER IN THE MARKET - WHAT DO YOU SAY MAKES YOU
STAND OUT? We don’t have a specific biggest-selling print per se, as people end up liking
a dozen of our prints. Anyone who admires a large colour palette and different use cases
such as various occasions that they wear our products to, usually love all the prints! As
for the cluttered market, at the time, we introduced something that was lacking. Now we
see others have taken note of it, but this is just the beginning of a much bigger brand.
We have collections that are ready to go out to the world, our mission as always, is to
take our Sri Lankan brand international. To compete with global statement fashion brands
has always been our end goal. Q HOW CAN ONE PLACE AN ORDER FROM YOU? It’s easy; find us on
social media either under our Instagram, @la.ceylone or search for our Facebook page, ‘La
Ceyloné,’ then, select a design from our recent images and drop us a message to order it,
that’s it! Until the lockdown eases, we will be delivering within Colombo. Afterwards, we
will be back to delivering island-wide. Q WHAT HAS THIS GLOBAL PANDEMIC TAUGHT OUR LOCAL
BUSINESSES AND STARTUPS? We think Sri Lanka is a resilient nation. If at all, it has
taught us like everything in our past, from natural disasters to wars, to recent terroristevents, we have gotten through it all, and that this too, shall pass. An important lesson
that we have learned, and will keep on learning, is to keep our heads held high and not to
break under pressure. Q HOW MANY FACE MASKS ARE OUT IN THE MARKET? WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO
CUSTOMIZE, IF NEEDED? Right now, we are working on global orders for the face masks, but
with our current resources, we are also manufacturing a handful to cater to the local
market. We plan on increasing our production soon, which will allow us to take any number
of orders possible. As for the customizable element, we’re looking into it! Q WHAT WOULD
YOU SAY ARE 5 IMPORTANT ITEMS WHICH NEED TO BE IN ANY MAN’S WARDROBE TODAY? A pair of
jeans that you can throw around with any outfit, a dress shoe, a pair of shades to beat
the heat, a La Ceyloné shirt, and given the current circumstances, a facemask. After all,
an expressive man is a fashionable one! Photography - you're my favorite Danu is a Jaffna

Feb 15 2022. HSBC Colombo Fashion Week announces New season with special emphasis on
Societal and Environmental Wellbeing, Emerging Designer Fund, NextGen Award, Responsible
Meter, CFW Accelerate This edition of HSBC Colombo Fashion Week intensifies its focus on
developing a fashion eco-system that has Environmental and Societal wellbeing at its heart
by introducing its theme Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive. This season which is planned
for 24th to 26th of February expands its scope in the new normal environment by developing
a series of programmes that not only supports Emerging Designers but also creates a system
that allows designers to have sustainability at the core of their design philosophy. In
2022, CFW, a development organization, enters its 19th year, throughout this time emerging
designer programme has remained a key initiative of CFW. This year it extends this
programme further by announcing the HSBC Fashion Fund for high potential designers who
showcase at Colombo Fashion Week. This fund focuses on supporting designers who need
financial assistance to move ahead in these challenging times. The HSBC Emerging Designer
Fashion Fund will identify five high-potential young designers through a panel. The names
will be announced after evaluation at the end of February 2022. This is HSBC’s 15th year
as the title partner of Colombo Fashion Week and during that time this partnership has
seen the fashion industry of Sri Lanka expand into an eco-system that encourages new
generations to come into the design industry. To celebrate this milestone, in addition to
the HSBC Fashion Fund, HSBC also announces its second collaboration The Responsible Meter
which creates a pathway for designers to start a sustainable supply chain. The Chief
Executive Officer for HSBC Sri Lanka and the Maldives, Mark Surgenor stated “HSBC is
delighted to be completing its 15th year of support for this most sought after showcase of
Fashion, Design, and creativity in Sri Lanka. Celebrating our 130th year in Sri Lanka as
the leading international Bank, we are delighted through our partnership with CFW to be
able to continue to support the opening of a world of opportunity for our clients,
designers and the Fashion industry in Sri Lanka” Responsible Meter is a one of its kind
garment tool that evaluates the impact of a designer's supply chain on Environmental and
Societal wellbeing. This scoring is to guide designers and to make consumers aware of
their purchases. Shangri-La Hotel Colombo, the official Host hotel, has also yet again
partnered with CFW this season. This partnership has strengthened over the years and share
similar values on the responsibility towards the environment. Speaking on the partnership,
Mr. Herve Duboscq the General Manager of Shangri La Hotel Colombo said, “As we partner
with HSBC Colombo Fashion Week for the fifth consecutive year, we are consistently
inspired by the values and evolving aesthetics embraced by the event, including this
year’s theme – ‘Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive,’ that emphasizes mitigating the
impact on Sri Lanka’s diverse wildlife and natural landscapes,’ said Herve Duboscq,
General Manager, Shangri-La Colombo, and One Galle Face. ‘Reflecting our own aim to create
colourful moments of joy for our guests in a sustainable manner, we’re also enthusiastic
that this year’s edition of CFW will provide a rich showcase for the work of many talented
designers, whilst bringing salient focus to the meaningful ideals embodied by the event.
This season is the second year that UNFPA partners with CFW to bring attention to sexual
and gender-based exploitation of women. The apparel and the fashion industry boasts of
healthy women participation in its supply chain making them important stakeholders. This
aspect of societal wellbeing plays an important role in arresting this exploitation.
Designer Amilani Perera integrates this aspect in her collection to be shown. WNPS
(Wildlife and Nature Protection Society) partners with CFW to highlight Environmental
issues that need attention, the month of February is called the month of Wetlands as these
important ecosystems need attention and preservation. Established in 1894, WNPS is the
third oldest conservation society in the world and the largest and most active in SriLanka. This season also sees the introduction of the Italy Award by The Embassy of Italy
for a talented young designer. The award also includes a financial reward and a
scholarship to study fashion at a prominent design institute in Milan. At this edition,
there will be important Sri Lankan designers showcasing, like Charini Suriyage, Dimuthu
Sahabandu, Sonali Dharmawardena, Amilani Perera, Fouzul Hameed, Indi Yapa Abeywardena,
Asanka De Mel, Dinushi Pamunuwa, Kamil Hewavitharana, Achala Leekoh, Himashi Wijeweera,
Divya Jayawickrama, Ayesh Wickramaratne, Nilusha Maddumage. In total there will be 23 Sri
Lankan designers showcasing. This year after a gap of two years, CFW invites three
prominent South Asian designers to show at HSBC Colombo Fashion Week. The famous Pakistani
designer Rizwan Beyg, Woolmark Ward winner Suket Dhir and RimZim Dadu from India will be
part of the line-up. These designers are also part of the knowledge-sharing programme with
Sri Lankan designers. For the first time CFW partners with South Beach Weligama a
designed-based development that finds synergy with CFW on pillars of sustainability,
creative lifestyle, and trends. The Hair Looks for each day will be presented by
Tressemme, the official haircare partner, an expert brand that also partners New York
fashion Week. Vision Care is the Official Eyewear Partner for Colombo Fashion Week and has
been so for the last five years. In its role as the leading eye care brand in the country
with over 55 branches located islandwide, Vision Care is unwavering in its commitment to
driving the sector to achieve greater heights. Another first partnership with CFW, the
official Makeup partner for the season is Beautybyrosh, an inclusive Australian brand
founded by Rosh Kumarasinghe of Sri Lankan origin. The brand is cruelty-free, vegan,
ethical, and sustainable, and works towards creating a more inclusive space in the global
beauty community. Ramani Fernando Salons is Sri Lanka’s largest and leading hair & beauty

Official Hair and Make-Up Partner for Colombo Fashion Week since 2003, they continue to

life_fashion90_12_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_Day_1.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week Day 1
Mar 22 2018. Day 1 of the HSBC Colombo Fashion Week (CFW) for Spring/Summer ’19 kicked off
yesterday at Hilton Colombo. Celebrating 15 years of CFW, the all Sri Lankan lineup for
Day 1 presented a grand opening of stellar proportions as colours burst on the runway in
flowly silhouettes and stunning designs. “Day 1 was exciting and interesting. Aslam
Hussein was amazing. He only started with us last year. It is a proud moment when I spend
6-7 months with them and they come back with a collection like this. Can’t wait for the 3
more days of fashion!” says Founder and President of Colombo Fashion Week, Ajai Vir Singh.
CEO of CFW , Fazeena Rajabdeen shares similar sentiments as she tells us “it’s a great
start to the runway shows celebrating 15 years! Happy to have kicked off Day 1 with
Upeksha, Meraki, Jai and Aslam Hussein highlighting the key trends.” U by Upeksha Hager
Having begun her fashion journey back in 2011 with her first show at CFW, Upeksha’s label
is one that offers fresh designs with an eye for detail and finish. A whimsical brand with
a love for classic silhouettes and fine finish, this year’s collection was inspired by the
café culture and the feminine flair of European cities. Various prints in box shapes and
loose silhouette added an ethereal touch to the ensemble. The collection was made complete
by flared frills and elaborate bows with a signature floral motif running in each design.
“This collection is for the girl that puts on her best dress to walk down the promenade
just because she can!” La’ Sari by Nilanka Silva A brand that initially started off as a
hobby is now a thriving business. Her tagline being “individuality celebrated”, her design
aesthetic is inspired by her day to day observations and the beauty she feels. Inspired by
the bright and untamed colours of the ‘Holi’ Festival, this collection was a whirl of
vivid colours in handcrafted silks, chiffons and cotton . Transferring casual clothing
into chic , La’Sari wowed the audience with the ombre upscale wear collection in vibrant
hues of the sunset, flora and the ocean. “This is my second time doing a collection with
CFW and I am looking forward to doing more with them. The collection really puts focus on
the flowy silhouettes ” Merkai by Sharmila Ruberu Where elegance meets comfort, Meraki
stayed true to its style ethos of minimalism in its collection. Inspired by the architect
Tadao Ando, Meraki presented an ensemble of muted colours of white, black and grey. All
designs were made using a mid-weight satin fabric with a special focus on minimum wastage
cutting. Her steel framed handbags in geometric patterns were a hit! “As usual, it’s great
to be a part of CFW. I really liked Tadao Ando’s minimalist and futuristic style and that
inspired me to make this collection.” Amilani Perera Amilani Perera is a ready- to-wear
luxury fashion brand that juxtaposes chic styles with traditional Sri Lankan cultural
motifs. Her brand is 100% cruelty-free and she uses premium vegan materials in her
designs, making her brand a unique bespoke designer wear label in Sri Lanka. Her
collection embodied the brand’s signature look with the use of Sri Lanka’s national bird
‘Jungle Fowl’ in geometric forms. The eveningwear collection featured lush silhouettes
with pixilated prints and embroidery in earthy hues along military lines. “This collection
is designed to portray the strong yet sensitive side of the modern woman and the majestic
jungle fowl symbolizes the resilience of the persevering Sri Lankan woman. I will also be
donating the proceeds of this collection to projects supporting women lead households in
areas directly affected by the war.” Jai by Jaish Jayasinghe Launched in 2012 from the
House of Aashkii, Jai is a brand that derives inspiration from Jaish’s unique life
experiences which are a reflection of nature’s aesthetic. Her collection ‘Rafiki’ was
inspired by her travels in Africa, transferring the wild into design . From feather
patterns of the Congolese peafowl to the peacocks and the cheetahs roaming the jungles,
Africa came alive on the runway through her creative use of prints, fabrics, and

worked hard on this beautiful collection. It was a fusion collection and I used camouflageprints to really highlight the theme behind the collection.” G by Gihan Ediriweera A
freelance fashion designer specializing in tie and dye art, he has been a part of CFW
since 2012 and this collection marks his 7th for CFW. This year’s collection drew
inspiration from the movie adaptation of the fairy tale ‘Cinderella’ with colour palettes
picked from different segments in the movie. Soft cotton blends met refined rayons as the
runway explored in an ever-changing colour palette in off shoulder silhouettes. The pastel
colours of yellow, pink and blue spun a fairytale on the runway! “I’m excited. I really
liked the collection; it was one of my dreams that became a reality. I wanted to make it
simple, girly yet colourful .” Aslam Hussein Celebrating over 25 years of fashion, Aslam
Hussein is the creative force behind Gee Bees Designer Studio and is reputed to be among

using luxe fabrics sourced from his travels overseas. Silks, organza, and brocade
embroidered with dainty floral motifs have been transformed into fabulous haute couture
dresses. Aslam’s collection showed off the unique engineering skills he employs to create
such fine structural gowns with features such as pleats, folds, exaggerated sleeves and
asymmetrical hemlines. “I’m really happy to have created some wonderful designs to impress

life_fashion90_12_Hugo_Boss_Opens_Its_First_Sri_Lankan_Store.pdf,"Hugo Boss Opens Its First Sri Lankan Store
May 08 2017. Hugo Boss, the 92 year old luxury brand with a focus on menswear, recently
opened its first store in Colombo. The space is located at the Arcade Independence Square
- a beautifully restored British colonial building constructed in 1889 that was once home
to an asylum. Colombo’s retail market has seen the arrival of a few international brands
but none with the luxury fashion reputation of Hugo Boss. At the opening, an eye-catching
video display was set against the classical façade of the Arcade Independence Square for
the viewing pleasure of invited guests, which showed the history of the brand and its
ethos. What men need now is an alternative, and more flexible approach to suiting that
will take you from a workday to the weekend. The dizzying rate of change in the way the
modern man now chooses to dress has left some more traditional labels reeling but one of
the world’s biggest brands has chosen to embrace change and accept that there is a whole
world beyond the grey suit. Hugo Boss may have been built into a global fashion behemoth
thanks to generations of men who have bought its suits as essential office wear but as the
workplace has become more casual and the shirt and tie brigade is rapidly being replaced
by the T-shirt and smart sneaker squad, the brand is rising to the challenge. The suit may
well be far from death, but what the world now wants is an alternative and a more flexible
approach to a working - and weekend - wardrobe and that is precisely what the Boss team
delivers. Wedding suits are a huge market segment that this new store will also cater to
as the Boss Menswear Store stocks both formal and sportswear collections. Your comment (*)",1736

life_fashion90_12_The_Joy_in_Happinesswear.pdf,"The Joy in Happinesswear
Mar 12 2025. Rashmi Wijekoon, the founder and driving force behind Joey Clothing, has
built a brand on the concept of ‘Happiness’—fashion that brings confidence, comfort, and
true happiness to the consumer. Joey Clothing began as a passion project in 2018 and was
incorporated as a business in 2021. Today, Joey Clothing continues to set new trends with
this feel-good fashion standard. We got ahold of this busy entrepreneur to ask her more
about her ‘Happinesswear’ brand. You have such a high academic background and credentials,
what made you chose fashion after such a long stint in business and science? As a teen, I
believed my path was set for academia or the corporate world. I was always an ambitious
student, excelling in academics—topping my batch at Colombo University in Chemistry,
followed by CIMA and an MBA, leading to an 8+ year corporate career in chief MNCs and
conglomerates. Everything changed once I became a mother. Rather than continuing down the
traditional corporate route, I chose to channel my expertise into something more
personal—fashion that empowers. I saw a gap in the Sri Lankan market for a homegrown brand
that balanced affordability, quality, and design innovation. Joey Clothing became the
perfect blend of strategy, creativity, and purpose—designing stylish, comfortable clothing
that adapts to real bodies and real lifestyles. What fabrics do you usually use and is
there any significance to that? At Joey, fabric selection is at the heart of our design
process. We prioritize materials that feel as good as they look—soft, breathable, and
versatile fabrics that enhance comfort without compromising on style. Tell us the story
behind how you caught the ‘fashion bug’ and why your brand is called Joey Clothing’?
‘Fashion is a powerful form of self-expression and confidence. My journey into fashion was
born from a personal need. The ‘fashion bug’ bit me after I became a mother, I struggled
to find clothing that was both stylish and comfortable, something that made me feel good
in my own skin. That is when I realized there was a gap in the market, and more
importantly, an opportunity to create something meaningful. Always having been very
particular about what I wear, I decided to start designing for women who wanted effortless
style without compromising on comfort. Seeing how the right outfit could boost confidence
and happiness sparked my passion for creating ‘Happinesswear.’ If you wear something that
makes you happy, you just look better—it’s that simple. From the very beginning, Joey
Clothing was about happiness. I wanted to create a brand that wasn’t just about fashion,
but also about how clothes make you feel. The name ‘Joey’ comes from joy, the core idea
behind our brand. It represents comfort, confidence, and feeling good in your own skin. As
a brand we prioritize authenticity, understanding that fashion should empower and adapt to
every stage of a woman’s life. What makes Joey Clothing the best is our commitment to
providing high-quality, stylish clothing that embraces real bodies and real lifestyles.
We’ve built our brand around the concept of Happinesswear, meaning that when women wear
our pieces, they not only look great but feel great too—whether at home, at work, or on
the go. How do you get the community involved in your operation how many artisans are
involved? I started Joey Clothing with no infrastructure. Manufacturing was a struggle, as
none of the factories were willing to take on the smaller quantities I needed. That’s when
the artisans stepped in. They believed in my vision and supported me, helping to get the
brand off the ground by working with me on smaller batches. Today, we manage two stitching
communities in Malwana and Athurugiriya, where skilled artisans bring our designs to life
from the comfort of their homes. These partnerships are not just about production—they’re
about empowerment. We employ over 35 artisans, providing them with stable jobs, fair
wages, and, more importantly, flexibility which allows them to support their families
financially without disrupting their roles as mothers and wives. As we continue to expand,
our model remains rooted in these community-based operations, ensuring we maintain
flexible, high-quality production that is human-centered. What advice would you give toupcoming entrepreneurs? One of the biggest lessons I've learned is the importance of
investing in the right people and grooming talent. Surround yourself with a strong,
passionate team that believes in your vision and supports each other through challenges.
At Joey Clothing, we’ve made it a point to nurture young talent, providing them with
opportunities for growth and development. When you invest in your people, you’re building
a foundation for long-term success. Stay true to your vision, keep moving forward, and
remember that the challenges you face will help you grow. Where can we buy Joey Clothing?
Joey Clothing is available at our online store, where we offer a seamless shopping
experience with delivery options globally. Our website features our full range of
collections, allowing you to explore our designs, check sizes, and shop with ease. We have
2 physical stores; the flagship store at Colombo 5 ( Isipathana Mawatha), and our urban

exclusive clothing from handpicked finest quality linen and cotton materials with soothing
colors which are of course easy to wear and feel comfy. The collections are always based

goals”. Fashion Experiences Please do share few instincts about your latest
collection/upcoming collections? Our latest collection will be covering a range of casual
wear with printed linen wear ideal for the planned trips this December and a range of
formal wear for the New Year. What was the biggest motive/support behind starting up
""Alludeandco.clothing""? The co-founder is a marketer by profession and loves building
brands, thus her firm belief in consistency, delivering promises and quality is the key to
make the brand a success induced from her talented mother who has been engaged in a small
scale designer wear business platform. Since small days, she has been growing-up seeing
quality outfits being designed by her mother, with the advanced technology and new
business platforms being established in today’s context, thus the co-founder of the brand
wanted to take her mother’s inspiration to the next level. What are your inspirations and
how does it apply with your work? nWe are inspired by new challenges. We are a team of go-
getters who believe that nothing is impossible. We always have the positive attitude and
focus on each task in achieving our goals. nAlso, being around creative people inspires us
to think innovatively and of course explore something new, every day. We need fresh minds
to draw our creativity, therein explore new spaces and, enjoying little achievements in
life inspires us. nThese few things, allow us to look at things in different perspectives
and always drive ourselves to be focused and consistent. These are the key areas to focus
when building a good brand. What are the latest collection in store? We have a collection
of comfy linen jump suits and few casual evening wear dresses. How has your work evolved
since you began your own label? Early stages were a little hectic with developing the
brand proposition and business strategy whilst looking for potential young women to
produce our clothes. We wanted to ensure we light-up our workforce of young women to get
them to achieve their life goals whilst we achieve our business goals. Therein, we were
particular in finding a work force with positive attitude that could do quality stitching.
Now we have an established, young, self-driving work force that delivers on-time with
quality results. What advice would you give to the upcoming young designers who are also
willing to grow up as an entrepreneur in the industry? Be open-minded, focus and
commitment is all what you need to grow. Always refer matured designers and feel free to
obtain their thoughts as well. Read and explore to identify opportunities and trends.

you. Get it Right, if you want to be whom you aspire to be”. Instagram Page -

life_fashion90_13_Anavila_Misra_crafts_cross-cultural_identity.pdf,"Anavila Misra crafts cross-cultural identity
Jun 20 2024. Dubbed a love letter to summer, designer Anavila Misra wove her ode to the
Franco-Tamil culture of Puducherry in the second of the Textile Talks series at the
Rithihi flagship store at Alfred House Gardens recently. Mesmerised by the heady scents
and palette of the hues of French influence that mixed effortlessly into the backdrop of
Tamil culture when she first visited Puducherry in 1999, Anavila’s ÉTÉ Collection depicts
the modernity yet traditionality of the sari drape. The cross-cultural narrative behind
ÉTÉ which transcends geographic boundaries and into the infinity of the ethno-European
cultural space has been perfectly encapsulated by Rithihi using Sri Lankan muses of mixed
identities to showcase the blend of tradition and modern in the everyday woman. Rithihi
captures Marine Researcher Ramani Jayawardena and physiotherapist and Kuppameniya Founder
Melanie Daetwyler-De Silva who are both of Swiss-Sri Lankan origin. In addition, Interior
Designer and multi-faceted entrepreneur Annika Fernando who has a Sri Lankan father and
mother who were Dutch, Danish and Austrian with a German upbringing realised the relevance
of the Anavila story to Sri Lanka. Anchoring the saris on a canvas of white with the rose
as the primary motif, Anavila explained the thought process behind the collection to the
intimate audience gathered at the store. “The idea of a summer collection danced in my
head for a long time and when I went back to Puducherry 25 years later, I could see that
cultural fluidity in the drape of linen saris – the ease, the grace and the elegance which
is very much the persona of the South Asian woman. Linen is the perfect celebration of
that cross-pollination of cultures that fuse the Tamil and French way of life.” Each of
the saris is an opus; a legacy regaling a story of a passionate experiment blended with
indigenous textiles and artisanal skill. With a desire to modernize and deconstruct the
age-old sari, ÉTÉ holds within its weaves elements of a garden in full bloom or the minute
detailing of a single feature symbolic of a languid summer day. As Ramani mentions,
“Garments shouldn’t necessarily represent cultural identity; they can stand alone as
statements. The way Anavila drapes saris shows how easily they can be perceived as Western
outfits.” The piece de resistance in the ÉTÉ collection is the ivory khadi silk sari that
took a team of applique artisans and hand embroiderers 400 days to complete. The detailing
is meticulous, the work exacting and the process surely exhausting, but it is an oeuvre
that chronicles the entirety of how artisanal hands weave cultural identity into an ever-
evolving newness. Your comment (*)",2737

Oct 27 2021. Introducing another edition of Swim Week Colombo which will take place on
12th and 13th November founder and President of CFW Ajai Vir Singh said ""This show will be
a season of hope through positivity held in a responsible manner. The event is close to
the December season and also is a wedding time, which will capture consumers We intend to
showcase these messages through luxury resort wear."" Sri Lanka is fast becoming a popular
location for destination weddings and keeping his finger on the pulse of the regions
fashion requirements Singh is keen to encourage Sri Lankan designers to take advantage of
this burgeoning market segment. Commenting on the overall format of the show Singh
explained ""It's a new format overall. The show is very interesting this year. The first
day, where it will be held at the grand ballroom, Shangri La has a beautiful size so the
set is going to look marvelous. Day 2 is a venue provided by Sail Lanka and that place is
interesting as well. This will enable creativity and help us come up with new things
there. It's a new format."" This season Singh has selected environment is luxury as its
theme. The responsible fashion summit which is very much a part of Colombo fashions weeks
agenda will be held at the Shangri La with the support of the JAAF Sri Lanka apparel. This
event will bring together both international and local stakeholders to discuss the
betterment of the industry. Singh's ambitious dream has been to make Sri Lanka the fashion
hub of South Asia. Commenting on his plan Singh said ""It's a journey. It's going to take a
long time to get there. There is an infusion and influence that comes in South Asia in
terms of fashion, craft and other various things. That gives rise to a very defined South
Asian identity and you see our designers here, Charini and Indi and they've been on the
journey over 10 years. It's always a journey and as we evolve these influences will come
and have a stronger Asian kind of a look. My issue with the debate is why do people say
Western wear vs ethnic wear. It should be South Asian wear or Eastern wear. So that is why
I want to give prominence to our designers here. So that is the kind of South Asian thing
I have in mind. Plus, sustainability we are far ahead among many Asian nations. If you are
more sustainable, you are more ahead in providing solutions. So, we want to take the lead
in being leaders of sustainability, leaders in solution. We are launching a type of meter
which will evaluate garments and look at the score the garment has based on
sustainability. Those are the unique things we have done."" Singh also explained that Based
on the quality and season, they have chosen designers. ""We have also considered how they
have presented their collections, which reflects the current situation in society. The
theme will showcase the 'new normal' and self-sustainability in a luxurious manner"" he
added. Organising and executing an event of this nature requires collaborations with
industry stakeholders. This year, CFW will partner with Ramani Fernando Salons, NTB, Sail

life_fashion90_13_Chaos_clothing_Luxury_-Minimal-_Affordable.pdf,"Chaos clothing: Luxury -Minimal- Affordable
Feb 20 2018. The online business initiated through Instagram and Facebook has been
successful in the years passed and now we see another clothing store “Chaos Clothing”
blooming via Instagram with their platform filled with inspiration and style. It is purely
an online store and it is the only channel for their customers to purchase their products.
This also doubles as a unique value proposition in addition to their low price point for
quality, fashion-forward clothing. Launched in June 2017, the team wasn’t happy with the
choice of stylish clothing offered in Sri Lanka, and thereby decided to start up Chaos by
introducing luxury attire without a high price tag! The theory behind selecting their
styles is that, you could either dress up or dress down with. For instance, for any of the
Chaos dresses, you could wear it to fancy dinner or you could also wear it with sneakers
for a fun day out. They offer pieces that keep up with the trend internationally which
includes pants, skirts, tops and dresses. They cater to girls and women mostly between the
ages of 15- 30. IF you are: 1. A babe who is young, fun and confident - wear their
Bodysuit or “Lydia” top. 2. All about finding a timeless piece that compliments and
celebrates your individual beauty - wear their off-the-shoulder dresses 3. A minimalist
who loves a bit of luxe - wear their “Amelia” shift dress Prices tend to range from
Rs.1500 to Rs.4500 depending on the style and material. “We strive to keep our pricing
competitive for every product that we offer, as this ensures that we not only gain new
customers but retain repeat customers,” said the team. Chaos gives everyone a perfect
balance of on-trend and timeless style, with new arrivals appearing weekly. “We are trying
to create an online platform where girls and women feel confident ordering online. With
our Instagram page we try to let the buyers imagine what it would be like to own our
product. We bring them down from standard UK sizes and we also forward our customers
detailed size guides to check their measurements,” said the team. They provide next day or
same day delivery that would allow people to have it delivered to them at a moment’s
notice. Chaos seeks to provide items missing from their own wardrobes and to put them into
yours. Instagram: clothingbychaos Facebook: clothingbychaos Business enquiries:

life_fashion90_13_Designer_1-2-1___Gajan_Vinothan.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Gajan Vinothan
Dec 18 2017. Nurturing a dream from his youth which involved a career in fashion, Gajan
Vinothan claims he was always opinionated on what looks best on people. A distinct lack of
good quality clothing brands in Sri Lanka , led Gajan to launch his label Stripes & Checks
which caters to a young clientele who aspire to be trendy and fashion forward. Stripes &
Checks places their emphasis on made to measure shirts for men. What made you embark on a
career in fashion? Simply the fact that it is my passion. Fashion is not just about
clothing. It's a lifestyle. From my younger days I used to refer fashion and lifestyle
magazines and be up to date on latest trends and styles, and always was opinionated about
what looks best on people. Especially when it comes to personal styling, I knew what I
wanted to wear, what looked good and what statement I wanted to make. But living in Sri
Lanka, this was quite difficult to achieve with the limited access we had to quality
clothing brands (especially for men). This is what triggered me to build a brand that's on
par with other international brands when it comes to style, quality and fit. Name of label
? Stripes & Checks, ‘Stripes & Checks Inc. is a men's clothing company focusing
exclusively on customized, made-to-measure and ready to wear shirts. We pride ourselves of
the material, design and the fit of the shirts we offer. Our fabrics and accessories are
sourced from some of the top suppliers around the world. Our latest collection of work-
wear, formal and casual shirts are ideal for gift giving. What is your latest collection
called? I hardly name the collections. Describe this new collection? Our clothing line
especially focuses on customized made to measure shirts for men. We chose handpicked
quality fabrics and latest designs for our shirts that adds an exclusive, premium feel.
Apart from this, we also have the option of customizing your shirts with your choice of
collars, plackets, cuffs and monograms that makes your shirts unique and personal, and
adds a touch of subtle manly charm. How long have you been a designer for? We launched our
brand in 2014 and I have been designing since then. What are the challenging aspects of
running a fashion business in Sri Lanka? The industry is in a constant battle between
quality and cost. As a brand that promises to deliver high quality garments, we do not
want to compromise the quality of our shirts by using cheaper fabric or other material.
This is the biggest challenge we face with our competition in the industry. Nevertheless,
our customers do appreciate the quality we maintain consistently. Where do you retail your
stuff? Our flagship store at 70, Rosmead Place, Col 7. What is your top fashion tip? Happy
Socks for added contrast Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? I generally don’t shop in
Sri Lanka. Hence why I started this brand! Who is your muse? I gather inspiration from
various people I see Who would you like seeing dressed in your creations? Men with a great
sense of style and who are confident about their selves How do you balance creativity with
commerce? What is trending in fashion now might not necessarily be what our consumers are
inclined to purchase. Identifying designs/styles that would move well in our market is key
to keep the business viable. Which designers/brands are you influenced by? Eton Shirts,
Zara Men, Brooks Brothers, Eve and Kane, Thomas Pink What’s the best way to accessorise
your clothes Matching shoes and braided belts. Colourful socks. Tina Edward Gunawardhana

Nov 24 2020. Living by her personal motto of ‘being brave, facing challenges and a never-
give-up on your dreams’ attitude has helped designer Uddami Wijesekera launch her
eponymous brand. A graduate of the AOD, Uddami believes that designing gives her the
freedom to express herself through creativity with no boundaries with the end result being
an inexplicable sense of euphoria. What sparked your interest in fashion design? My
grandmother has been my biggest inspiration for me. It always amazed me how she recycled
and reused to create beautiful pieces of clothing. With her by my side, I started making
tiny clothing for my dolls as a 5-year-old girl, and that start has pushed me forward to
be who I am today. What made you take fashion more seriously & make a career out of it?
Since I was a little girl, I was passionate about creating new things. But, because of the
background that I grew up in, it was not my 1st choice. While I was going through
Universities in the Engineering field, I started questioning myself if that’s what “I”
really wanted to do. I have always wanted my career to be something that I would enjoy and
be excited to start working every morning. So, then I took the decision of making my
hobby, my career. Something that I will actually enjoy doing for a living. And that’s been
the best decision I have made in my life so far. How has your work evolved since you began
your own label? I launched my 1st collection under the brand name “UDDAMI” this year. But
I have been doing collections with FMLK since 2018. I have experimented with different
styles, crafts, colour combinations, prints, and techniques. This time period has helped
me develop my brand identity and its story while getting a better understanding of
customer requirements. Where do you look for creative inspiration? Inspiration is found
everywhere; it could be from a runway show, a vintage garment or a walk in nature. My
inspirations are mainly based on practicality and versatility while maintaining the
signature of the brand. I give high attention to details, the final fit, finishes and the
comfort of the garment. Describe your latest collection? My latest collection is an easy,
effortless and endlessly versatile capsule collection for the cool, modern, minimalist
women. With masterfully constructed folds and easy-on-the-eye colour combos, this new edit
is for the woman who glides effortlessly and stylishly through every occasion. Who is your
muse? A modern minimalist woman who’s open to change, challenging and loves to experience
new things. What are your sustainability credentials? UDDAMI is a humanitarian brand which
helps to donate and sponsor special needs children at Blue Rose Special School Kandy. It
is a school for children with Down Syndrome, hyperactive, autism etc. At the moment we
sponsor one student with education facilities, and a member of our team spends every
Tuesday at the school as a volunteer. So, the customer is given the chance to join a
charitable project with every purchase made. The brand also supports local artisans by
incorporating local crafts, such as handloom, batik, beeralu lace and embroidery. What are
you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? At the moment, I am
looking into contemporary, minimalist bridals. I have always been fascinated by intricate
detailing and soft drape feminine clothing. I am hoping to expand my brand while adding an
exclusive range in the near future. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since
you started your company? I launched my brand during a global pandemic, so I would say it
has not been the smoothest ride. But, it’s only by overcoming challenges we can push
ourselves forward. Maintaining the brand identity while serving the customer needs is
something that needs to be given attention to, and consistency is very important.
Transparency of the brand identity, brand story and values boost the customer’s loyalty
and reduces the gap in-between the customer and the brand. It is also very important to
maintain the sustainable and ethical values of the brand. What role do you think social
media plays in fashion today? From my perspective, social media has become the main source
of keeping up to date with the upcoming trends, inspirations, consumers and etc. It hascreated a great platform for the start-ups, to gain more awareness and exposure. The reach
is unlimited. Especially with the current global pandemic, social media has helped in
maintaining the customer-brand bond. It has created the opportunity for the customer to
feel more connected to the brand while creating more engagement, and this will result in
boosting the loyalty and likelihood to purchase a product. How do you want women to feel
when wearing your clothes? I want women to feel chic, sophisticated and powerful. Tina

life_fashion90_13_MERCEDES__BENZ_FASHION_WEEK_DAY_2.pdf,"MERCEDES – BENZ FASHION WEEK: DAY 2
Oct 30 2017. Day 2 of the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week kicked off on the 28 th of October
2017 at the Mercedes-Benz Centre of Excellence Dimo 800. The day’s theme was ‘Travel
Style’ and each collection was inspired with the avid traveller in mind. An evening of
colour, neon and prints were certainly a popular choice! MORI GIRL BY PRABATH
SAMARASOORIYA Somber hues of black, white, silver and grey formed the colour palette for
this collection. The ensamble focused heavily on loose silhouettes made with silk giving
each outfit a theatrical touch in its fluid presentation. LOWER EAST SIDE BY KUR
COLLECTION A monochromatic ensamble took to the ramp under the inspiration of the Lower
East Side. Ruffles and layers were a running theme consistent in each outfit and the hints
of silver added the glam effect to the collection. MONASTIC ZEN BY ISHARA JAYATHILAKE A
vision in white was what captivated the audience as the collection ‘Monastic Zen’ took to
the ramp. The standout features were in the details; from the strategically placed ruffles
to the carefully tailored netting. A trend seen in International Fashion Weeks this year,
sheer fabrics played a major role in this collection. FUTURE STREET BY HIDRAMANI Bold
cuts, daring colours and street style. Hidramani took street wear to the future with their
sporty collection at the show. A juxtapose between dark and light colour schemes, the
collection of jackets, pants, tops, shorts and dresses was trendy, chic and stylish.
RAINFOREST EXPLORER BY LONALI RODRIGO A collection inspired by the rainforest traveller,
designer Lonali together with Rainco presented their rainwear collection with a range of
raincoats and umbrellas in line with the theme. With prints incorporating wildflowers and
rainforest motifs, the collection was vibrant in its luminescent colour palette. The
ensamble created with polyester and coated fabric is aimed at the daring backpacker ready
to travel whatever the weather brings! ECLECTIC BLOOM BY TRUE DIGITAL PRINTING A splash of
colour exploded on the runway with this collection. Luminous hues are back and this season
there is no such thing as too much colour! Boxy silhouettes in luminous pink, green and
blue lit up the runway. Playing with prints of flora and fauna, the collection was
electrifying! NATURA BY TEEJAY This travel collection by Teejay is best described as
exotic and tropical. Focused on casual men’s and women’s wear, Teejay mixed and matched
various prints and patterns together. The vibrant colours mixed with different motifs were
a paradox; jarring and yet blending in together at the same time! SO CAL BY KANCHANA
FERNANDO Denim has never looked so good! Having teamed up with the LICC Jeans team, the So
Cal collection featured a variety of denim based outfits. Black tribal prints was the
signature mark of this collection and added details like silver and white tassels showed a
new denim style. The collection comprised of denim jeans, cutoffs, dresses, pinafores and
sarongs. OUTLANDER BY VOGUE TEX This elegant collection revolved entirely around the
shades of cream and white. The mono-coloured pieces highlighted the finer details in each
outfit. Delicate embroidery and sequins were used to make each piece pop! TROPICAL SPORT
BY BUDDHI BATIKS Buddhi Batiks gets sporty with their new athletic collection. A pioneer
brand in the Batik industry, this new collection set out a statement that batik is now a
part of sportwear. The brand’s leitmotif, floral print, was ever present in their range of
workout pants, tops, leggings and jackets. The collection also included a variety of
sporty accessories such as batik workout bags and caps. ATH OPULENCE BY MAS FABRICS
Athletics meets leisure in this collection! A mix and match of workout clothes with casual
outfits, this ensamble also mixed and matched prints and patterns in neon hues. URBAN
ATHLUXE BY MAS HOLDINGS A collection for the everyday girl, Urban Athluxe saw a range of
swimwear, intimate wear and sport wear take to the ramp. In pastel colours of silver, grey
and beige this collection was all a travel girl needs on her next adventure! ARUBA BY AQUA
ISLAND The finale for the night, this swimwear collection was simple but luxurious. With
nude as its selected colour scheme, the collection featured one piece and bikini swimsuitswith clean cut design and delicate detailing with sequins and lace. This elegant ensamble
was a lavish end for the night! Law Graduate, food and travel enthusiast and full time dog

life_fashion90_13_Theres_Something_About_Yellow.pdf,"There’s Something About Yellow
May 23 2017. When life gives you lemons, make lemonade, they say. And the thing about
yellow as a colour is that it cuts both ways, just like the fruit. It can be sharp and
acidic, but it is also optimistic in a simple, powerful way. From red carpet events to
casual sightings, different shades of yellow seems to be the ""in"" colour of choice for
Colombo fashionistas, as the style set opts for a little sunshine to brighten their
lineups. We are seeing a sunnier disposition with the abundance of yellow in their
wardrobes. Chandi and Shankar Co-founder of Rum Punch Binara Seneviratne (left) and
founder and designer of Rum Punch Rukshi Fernando (right) Elisha Gomes (left) and Shahili
Gomes (right) From pale buttercup to rich marigold, there's nothing as on trend as this
particular hue. Yellow (in its multitude of hues) was a favoured palette for many a
designer's and it continues to be the colour du jour. Often regarded as a tricky hue to
pull off, it comes in a spectrum of shades, from soft buttercup to hot marigold, so
there's certain to be a yellow to suit everyone. It's not only for women, fashionable men
love this hue too. (L - R) Rashmi, Ranil, Rishini and Ranmali Shobi and Deeshana Yellow
has a reputation for being terrifyingly difficult to wear, but it's not really, actually
yellow is easier to wear than you think. It's easier, for example, than beige, which can
wash some of us out. Or pastels which can sometimes give of an auntie vibe if not done
right! Lemon and other shades of yellow are not only relevant and fashion forward, they're
fresh and cheerful without being jolly or gung-ho. If you're not doing head to toe, keep
the other colours in your outfit to a minimum because, contrary to popular opinion, yellow
does go with other colours, but not too many at once. It looks excellent with grey, and
white, distinctly upmarket with tan and toffee shades. Yellow accessories like a clutch or
statement earrings are a great way to embrace the shade! Yellow dress designed by Marlon
Rae Yellow scarf designed by Catherine Rawson Yellow skirt designed by Amilani Perera It's
a colour that will work on the party circuit and will also work forever on a balmy
tropical evening by the sea with a cold cocktail and a warm breeze - so there's no need to
panic about the initial investment. All of the tones work well with crisp white separates
and paired back denim and they're all you need to bring a little sunshine to your wardrobe
lineup. Your comment (*)",2515
life_fashion90_13_The_Great_Fit_Fallacy_and_Other_Myths_That_Shape_How_Men_Dre.pdf,"The Great Fit Fallacy and Other Myths That Shape How Men Dress Today
Jul 15 2025. By Gayantha Perera For a species that once wrapped itself in loincloths and
called it a day, men have come a long way in fashion. Or have they? In 2025, we’re living
in a world where men’s closets are bigger, sneaker collections are sacred, and grooming
kits have their own PR reps. Yet, a few persistent myths still shape how men dress—and not
always in the most liberating ways. This month of inclusivity, I wanted to discuss gender
and what not directly. Let’s pop the buttons off some of these outdated beliefs and see
what’s really going on. Myth #1: Tailoring is Only for Suits and Special Occasions
Somewhere along the way, tailoring got typecast as something reserved for elites. Special
occasions or weddings, or that one time a guy needed to borrow a suit for a graduation.
But the truth? Tailoring is simply the art of making clothes actually fit your body. If
you are looking in the mirror and your shirt feels like it doesn’t fit, or your pants feel
long -I can’t believe I’m saying this – you can get them tailored for the perfect fit!
Whether it’s hemming your trousers, tapering your shirt, or just learning your shoulder
width, a good fit is the secret sauce behind style that looks effortless. You can be
wearing a hand-me-down blazer and still look like a million bucks if it’s tailored right.
And no, tailoring isn’t only for suits. That denim jacket? Those cargos? Your favourite
joggers? If they fit like they were made for you, congratulations—you’re tailored. Myth
#2: Athleisure Means You’ve Given Up There’s a persistent, snobby whisper in the wind that
says men who wear sweatpants in public have surrendered to the void. But modern athleisure
is anything but lazy. It’s intentional comfort, elevated design, and functionality wrapped
in one stretchy waistband. Athleisure has become a style ecosystem of its own—with local
brands like Carnage, F.O.A, and international legends like Adidas & Nike nailing the blend
between sleek and sporty. The 2020s man isn’t dressing for the gym or the couch. He’s
dressing for everything in between. Zoom call at 10, lunch run at 12, and a casual date at
7? Athleisure’s got your back (and glutes – if you're lucky). Myth #3: Real Men Wear
Neutrals Let’s be real—somewhere along the line, society decided that the male colour
wheel should begin and end with black, grey, navy, and maybe olive if he’s feeling spicy.
Enter colour theory, the underrated MVP of men’s fashion. Colours communicate. A pastel
pink shirt? That guy probably has emotional intelligence and knows his coffee order down
to the ratio of milk and water. A burnt orange hoodie? He doesn’t need validation—he is
the vibe. Skin tone, personality, and personal story all play into what colours resonate.
Luckily, consumer brands are catching on. I am impressed to see mass market retailers in
Sri Lanka are now pushing softer palettes and bold colour-blocking into menswear, and both
young and old consumers have favourite colours outside dark palettes. So if you’ve always
wanted to wear lavender but held back… consider this your permission slip. Myth #4:
Celebrities Know What They’re Doing It’s tempting to build a wardrobe by copying
celebs—after all, they have stylists, access, and a bottomless Gucci budget. But that’s
also the trap. The truth? Many male celebrities dress like they’re in a perpetual fashion
dare. For every Timothée Chalamet moment that pushes boundaries, there’s a dozen confusing
attempts involving leather kilts, cowboy hats, or full-on Renaissance cosplay. Do they
pull it off? Sometimes. Should you copy them? Not unless it aligns with your own style
DNA. What you can take from celebs is confidence. Stylespiration is fair game, but
imitation without adaptation usually ends in regret—or at least awkward photos. Myth #5:
Brands Define Your Style Here’s the mind-bender: the brands you wear say something, but
not everything. In a time when brand loyalty is big business, men are often told that
identity = label. But having your whole personality bottled in one logo is kind of
limiting, no? That said, brands do understand their demographic—and some are getting
better at speaking directly to modern men. From Deedat’s clean minimalism to Darlee’s
vintage-urban nostalgia to GFLOCKs inclusive sizing and styling—there’s something outthere for everyone. But the best-dressed guys aren’t just followers of a brand’s story.
They remix it with their own narrative. So, Where Does That Leave Us? Fashion myths are
stubborn. They’re usually born from outdated norms, lazy marketing, or good old-fashioned
insecurity. But the men rewriting the rulebook today are the ones leaning into comfort,
experimenting with colour, and shaping identity through clothes—not in spite of it. Style
isn’t about myth-following. It’s about myth-busting. The modern man’s closet isn’t just
about what he wears—it’s about who he dares to be. A fashion stylist with a decade of
experience as an image expert and consultant to local retail brands, Gayantha offers
candid advice to men on Fashion and Grooming only on Daily Mirror's Life Plus. Your

life_fashion90_14_Buzz_with_Danu__Island_Life_with_Darshi_Keerthisena.pdf,"Buzz with Danu – Island Life with Darshi Keerthisena
Sep 03 2025. Fashion, for Darshi Keerthisena, has never been just about clothes. It’s
about stories, memories, and carrying the spirit of Sri Lanka into every stitch. Her
recent show, Island Life, brought seaside nostalgia to the runway with a fresh city chic
vibe, a collection that was as soulful as it was stylish. I sat down with Darshi to talk
about inspiration, challenges, and the legacy she hopes to leave behind. Here’s our
conversation. And knowing Darshi Keerthisena on a personal level, I can surely say that
carrying the soul of Sri Lanka into the world, one brush stroke, one batik, one story at a
time, has been her passion 1. Island Life on the runway was a celebration of seaside
nostalgia and city chic. What was the story you wanted to tell through this collection?
Darshi: For me, Island Life was really about memory. I kept going back to those childhood
mornings by the sea, hair full of salt, cousins running around, the horizon that felt
endless. At the same time, I wanted to show how that spirit still belongs in our lives
today, even in the city. It’s about carrying the ocean with you wherever you go. 2. Batik
has such deep roots in Sri Lanka — how do you keep it fresh, modern, and relevant for
today’s audience? Darshi: Batik is in our DNA, but if it stays still, it becomes stuck in
nostalgia. I like to think of it as a language you can always say new things with. We play
with different silhouettes, colours, and sometimes even technology, but what never changes
is that human touch. That’s what keeps it both modern and soulful. 3. The show flowed with
the rhythm of the tide, thanks to Rozanne’s choreography. How important is storytelling in
fashion for you? Darshi: Storytelling is everything. A dress by itself can be beautiful,
yes, but when you connect it with movement, music, and memory, it becomes alive. Fashion,
for me, is emotion stitched into fabric. 4. KESS worked their magic backstage. How do
collaborations with beauty and styling teams elevate the fashion experience? Darshi: I
always say fashion is never a one-woman show. It takes a whole circle of talent. KESS
brought out the mood of Island Life perfectly; the hair, the makeup, it all helped the
clothes breathe in a new way. When beauty, styling, and design come together, you’re not
just showing clothes, you’re creating a whole world. 5. Handcrafted fashion is at the
heart of your work. What role do artisans play in keeping Sri Lanka’s identity alive on
the global stage? Darshi: Our artisans are the heartbeat of Buddhi Batiks. Each wax crack,
each brush stroke, is a part of Sri Lanka’s story. On the global stage, what we’re really
showing is not just fashion, but a piece of our island’s soul. Without them, there is no
us. 6. From the beach to the city — how does Sri Lanka itself inspire your design
language? Darshi: This island never stops inspiring me. The colours of a sunset, the
patterns of temple carvings, even something as ordinary as a railway seat it all feed into
design. From the calm of the sea to the buzz of Colombo, Sri Lanka is my mood board every
single day. 7. You’ve been recognised as a Sri Lankan woman shaping history. What does
being honoured in this way mean to you personally? Darshi: Honestly, it’s humbling. For
me, it’s not about the title, it’s about what it represents. It means batik and craft are
being valued, and women’s work is being seen. Standing next to women like Kasturi reminds
me that we’re all part of a bigger story, building something together. 8. As a woman
leader in the creative industry, what challenges have you faced and how have you turned
them into strengths? Darshi: There are always challenges balancing creativity with
business, working in spaces that are still male-dominated, proving that craft can stand
next to luxury. But I’ve learned to turn those into fuel. They’ve made me more resilient,
more daring, and more committed to creating a space where women’s creativity has power. 9.
How do you see fashion contributing to the empowerment of women in Sri Lanka? Darshi:
Fashion has two sides of empowerment. For the women who wear our clothes, it’s about
confidence in how you carry yourself. For the women who make them, it’s about livelihood,
independence, dignity. At its best, fashion isn’t frivolous; it can change lives. 10. Yourjourney with Buddhi Batiks has been groundbreaking. What’s the legacy you hope to leave
for the next generation of designers? Darshi: I hope they don’t see batik as “just craft,”
but as a wide-open design language. I want them to inherit a stage where heritage and
innovation can sit side by side, and where Sri Lankan design holds its own globally. If I
can leave behind courage, creativity, and a sense of community, that’s a legacy worth
having. 11. Do you feel Sri Lankan batik has reached its global moment, or is the best
still yet to come? Darshi: I think we’re still at the beginning. The world is craving
authenticity and stories, and batik has both. We’ve had moments of recognition, but the
real moment for our global chapter is still ahead. I truly believe batik is Sri Lanka’s
gift to the world of fashion. 12. Finally, if you had to describe “island living” in three
words through fashion what would they be? Darshi: Joy. Timeless. Free. Danu is a Jaffna

wanted it). He has been a part of the team for seven years and is the face behind Buzz

keen on what was available in the market, because I preferred more simple and dainty
designs. Thus I started making my own for work, and then it just evolved from there. What
made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Fashion isn’t a fulltime
career at the moment. I currently work in Development as an Advocate for the most
vulnerable communities around the island, having previously served in Government for
nearly a decade. After designing sarees for my personal wardrobe which often got positive
feedback on the designs and style, my mother was the biggest advocate for launching my own
brand and she encouraged me to do so! Given that my work can be quite a stressful
environment, fashion gave me an outlet to do something fun and explore my creative side.
It has been a passion, but not one I was able to pursue professionally in the past. Where
do you look for creative inspiration? I look for inspiration everywhere. Mostly online,
but I also love spending time with books and magazines. Describe your latest collection?
My latest is the ‘Botanic Collection.’ Definitely all of my favourites – combined. These
sarees consist of floral prints with pleasing aesthetics, pastel colours, pearls and
accessories - some of which have been sourced from micro-enterprises from other parts of
the island such as the Eastern Province. Who is your muse? My muse is the Sri Lankan woman
- she’s employed, driven, passionate, playful, she’s independent and has a point of view.
I want my label to help her express all these facets of her, be it at work or at a social
gathering. What are your sustainability credentials? All my materials are locally sourced,
much of it which is from small-time vendors. I also work with seamstresses who are home-
based and my packaging is near zero plastic. What is the biggest lesson that you have
learned since you started your company? Being resilient. I’ve navigated a series of
obstacles from inception. I took the plunge and decided to do something that was
completely foreign to me by treading on unknown waters, at the worst possible time. Adding
to this, I started with occasion wear sarees (which is my main segment) – when we are in
the middle of cancelling all social events. Sourcing remotely, and working with different
entities to establish the brand itself was a challenge. What’s your motto? Do all things
with love. What role do you think social media plays in fashion today? I think social
media plays a vital role in fashion today especially under the current climate with the
global pandemic. It has certainly been instrumental in building my brand and provided a
platform for entrepreneurs like myself to start a business in fashion. It has enabled us
to target our client base, establish a personal connection with them and expand our reach
locally as well as globally. It has connected us with other stakeholders in the fashion
industry as well. What is your favourite part about being a designer? To be honest, I have
loved absolutely every aspect of it. I really enjoy exploring for materials whilst getting
acquainted with the local communities and I’ve not just restricted myself to doing this in
Colombo, but when I travel out of Colombo as well. I love handpicking the materials and
designing that perfect piece. When I see a fabric, colour or print, almost every time, I
am able to visualize exactly what I want to do with it. I think that would probably be my
most favourite part. Even though my pieces are very simple in its style, there is a lot of
my time and energy that is invested in each piece. These pieces are made with a lot of
love and passion and I feel very attached to all of it. How do you want women to feel when
wearing your clothes? I love this question. I want women to be empowered by wearing mypieces. I want them to be confident in who they are and to experience that magical moment
of loving how they look. For me, a saree can really do that. When I started wearing sarees
to work, it gave me a lot of confidence and I instantly noticed a difference in how people
would respond to me! It really gave me a lot of confidence and made me feel good about
myself. I want everyone else to feel the same way when they wear one of my sarees. To
date, my favourite attire is saree. It’s the reason I chose to start my brand with sarees
and create pieces which are very simple so that it can boost a woman’s confidence and help
them to embrace their own beauty. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

life_fashion90_14_Designer_1-2-1_Sarah_Deen_Ismail.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Sarah Deen Ismail
Oct 26 2021. Creating a buzz amongst the island’s fashion savants Sarah Ismail’s brand
fusion14 is growing in popularity. Starting off on a small scale fusion14 initially
founded by Sarah’s mother has grown exponentially and she has now branched into soft
furnishings too. Having learnt the art of batik Sarah runs her own workshop creating her
batiks in various hues and designs. In operation for over 15 years, it is only now that
the brand has come into its own with an ever-increasing number of devoted fans. What
sparked your interest in fashion design? Having grown up with an exposure to fashion, I
was always drawn to create clothing. I would accompany my mother, the founder of fusion14,
frequently on purchasing trips overseas and was able to gain a wealth of knowledge from
those experiences and different cultures. Those experiences have influenced my style and
design till today. I’m extremely lucky to have been nurtured in that kind of environment.
What made you take fashion more seriously? Having founded ‘Honey Pot’, a premier ladies
waxing salon in Colombo, at the age of 21 alongside my sister and mum, once we were able
to get things running smoothly, I was able to give more attention to fusion14. I handle a
more back-end role in this business so I was able to balance both. From a boutique that
would primarily purchase goods from different corners of the world, and then resell them;
once I stepped in we began to manufacture and create our own pieces. The motivation to
take it more seriously was first, the demand for our clothing and of course the joy and
passion it ignited in me whilst creating my pieces. Are you self-taught? I’m self-taught
in every sense of the word, I had the two best mentors to learn from in my experience.
First - my mother, I was taught every angle I needed to know to run a business, from
selecting fabrics, knowledge of presenting, marketing it and sales. My core values of
business and running a clothing brand comes through her wealth of experience of knowledge
and having studied business management and marketing for my undergraduate studies, this
helped me too. Mrs Saratha Vignarajah of Women Enterprises, was my mentor in teaching me
everything I needed to learn in the manufacturing area of garments, down to the neatness
of a seam, along with many technical terms I needed to learn in creating a pattern for
garments overall. These two powerhouses, strong and intelligent women have paved the way
forward for my career in design, and have indeed set extremely strong roots within me. How
has your work evolved? At 5 years old, my first ever class, was Art Class with Mrs Latifa
Ismail - and my love for art, colour, painting. The additive calmness art is able to
create within you while making art began from my early years. At 16 years old, my first
project was to create cropped tops out of stretch fabric. I mostly did this to make extra
pocket money at the time. I managed to sell every piece in our store which was a BIG win
for me! There on, I was drawn to make tops in tie and dye and those sold out too. This was
definitely a motivator for me. I had to continue my studies so fashion was on the back
burner for a while. I would still indulge in batik classes over the weekend at 17 at the
Janakala Kendra in Rajagiriya under the supervision of Kolvin Sir, and was able to learn
everything I needed to know about the process of batik. My work has since evolved into
creating pieces in batik, tie dye, and many other techniques. Although I feel I’m still in
my early days - I have already come a long way in terms of the evolution of my sense of
design and clothing. I am blessed to work with extremely talented, and skilled women who
are able to breathe life into my ideas. We create clothing with different varieties of
cottons and silk. We create our own batik prints and manage everything in-house. What kind
of clothing do you avoid? The only kind of clothing I would avoid is active-wear, men's
and swimwear, as I feel those aren’t areas of interest to me. Where do you look for
creative inspiration? Nature, travel, my childhood and everyday life! Describe your latest
collection For the new edit - I’ve used a different technique for the batik prints with a
combination of our signature styles and a few new silhouettes; this time around. I’mexcited to see how responsive my clientele would be to them. I’ve stuck to earthy tones,
and repetitive prints in order to create something new and fun to this edit. I’ve used
primarily cottons and a few silks that can be worn during the day and as loungewear. What
are your sustainability credentials? With the expansion of our new workshop, which would
give us more space - I intend on diving deeper into our excess waste material and how we
could maximise usage out of it. As a policy, although we have no choice but to import
certain fabrics, we still use excess factory fabrics - and they really are rare gems and
add to the unique character of our garments. We also have a circular system to our batik
section as well, so there is minimum wastage from start to finish. Currently we have an
entire line of accessories, homeware, gift items and even books that we create out of
excess fabrics. It’s truly fascinating and exciting when you realise the scope of what you
could create with a sustainable mindset. What are you currently fascinated by? Currently
whilst preparing for the season with a lot of hope despite everything that is going on
with the pandemic - we have decided to go through with our plans for expansion so that is
my top priority at the moment. This would be a big stepping stone for us in terms of
growth for the brand. What is the biggest lesson you have learned? No matter what curve
balls come your way. Stay true to yourself and PERSEVERE. What is your motto? “Faith,
gratitude, and strength moves mountains.” It isn’t easy to run your own brand - you’re
faced with many challenges and it’s easy to give up. It’s important to constantly check-in
with yourself and align with the bigger picture in mind. Who are the designers you’re
currently inspired by? At the moment, I’m currently in awe of artistes James Turrell and
Tuco Amalfi. How does the power of social media aid your business? Social media holds
immense power in getting your brand out there and known not just locally but on a global
scale too - I personally feel fusion14 is somewhat a hidden gem and we are lucky to have
built a loyal clientele over the years locally and internationally but this is something
that brands would need to consistently work through in order to stay current. Favourite
part about being a designer? The joy of seeing the evolution of a piece of fabric being
transformed into something that stems from a thought or feeling and finally being worn by
people. It gives me and my team great honour and satisfaction - a true motivator. How do
you want women to feel? Firstly, I want women to feel like they’ve bought something of
value for money and that they are able to maximise the garment in different ways so it’s a
conscious purchase and also having in mind that when you’re purchasing a garment, you
support a brand that in return supports the livelihoods of many women that are a part of
our brand. I design our silhouettes in primarily free sizes, that make you feel stylish
and comfortable all at once. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

life_fashion90_14_For_Him_By_Tiesh_-_Fashionably_Danu.pdf,"For Him By Tiesh - Fashionably, Danu
May 02 2017. Today we add some bling to this collection of images with the ""For Him""
collection, only available at Tiesh. Today, no look is complete without some subtle or
even over-the-top pieces for that shining look. As it's a growing trend today, I thought I
would highlight some ready to wear pieces from Tiesh. I spoke to Thiyasha and Ayesh De
Fonseka. Why did you guys decide to create the ""For Him"" collection? With an increasing
number of men wearing jewellery and buying jewellery for themselves together with the many
requests for men's gift items we have had. It was a natural step to take to meet our
clients' demands and to introduce the beauty of gold and silver accessories to the men's
world. There's a major design shift in men's jewellery - rich, precious materials and a
new style mood are the game changers. How do you decide what you wanted to create? Most of
the time, the inspirations come about upon my travels overseas. The fashion trends, the
colours and precious metals that are in trend and by adding our own unique Tiesh touch to
these trends, we create new and wonderful designs. What were your inspirations for the
designs you create? For the ""For Him"" collection, it was easy. I thought what would I like
to wear to accent my outfits to make it a tad special and also at the same time what is
keeping with today's fashion sense and trends. How do you select the materials you use to
create the pieces? We at Tiesh try extremely hard to use only Ceylon sapphires and Ceylon
gemstones so selecting materials as in gemstones that are in fashion, and furthermore all
Tiesh jewellery is handmade, as they are items created by our local craftsmen based in
both in our workshops in Colombo and head office in Kandy. Beyond applying basic
techniques, how does the jewellery designer evoke an emotional response to their
jewellery? I believe staying in close touch with what is in fashion and trending in the
world of fashion helps create an immediate response from our clientele. Also, the fact
that most of our designs are one of a kind and unique and that helps evoke a special
response. What kind of materials work well together, and which ones do not? I have a great
example. Most Sri Lankan love coloured stones so most coloured stones work well with gold,
rose gold, white gold or silver, but some colours look unattractive when used in the same
item. For example, rose gold and pink sapphires look too similar in colour and there is no
contrast so it won't look attractive when created into jewellery together. Who do you
envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? Actually
Danu, you are someone we always thought would be a great person to wear our men's
collection, but we have designs to fit everyone, from simple cufflinks, tie pins, and the
more flamboyant lapel pins or collar bars. What are some new pieces you are working on.
What are your plans for the coming future? We always have some new designs in the
pipeline. The next line for the men's collection we have are some designs using animal
shapes, the first of which was a dragonfly lapel pin, which we had a great response to, so
we will keep working on some new designs. Furthermore, we have a new ladies' collection we
are working on which will be launched later on this year. Let me just say it is
spectacular, but you will have to wait to see it. What prompted you to work on and create
an exclusive range for men? And how has the feedback been? As I mentioned before, there
were many requests from men wanting to get themselves something and ladies wanting to get
the special men in their lives something nice. Hence, we wanted to be the first jewellery
brand in Sri Lanka to have a dedicated collection for men. On the negative aspect, some
people have forgotten that we are mainly fine jewellery manufacturers set in gold but we
enjoy the new markets we have been opened up to since the launch of the ""For Him""
collection. How would you describe the fashion and style of Sri Lankan men? Two words I
would use is unique and wonderful. Sri Lankan men's fashion has come a long way in the
last 5 years. It's wonderful to see men finally wearing a jacket for formal events and I
think Sri Lankan men have been stuck in the ""smart casual"" fashion mentality for far toolong but now you can see men having their own sense of fashion unique to each individual
which is wonderful. Speaking to Arantha Sirimanne, this is what he had to say.. What are
your thoughts on the ""For Him"" collection? Well, jewellery is normally considered as
something women desire to have. But with Tiesh's new ""For Him"" collection, we men have a
chance of adorning ourselves with their creative pieces. What was the biggest challenge in
photographing this minute collection? As a photographer, shooting jewellery is one of the
most difficult pieces to photograph mainly because they are reflective items. And
especially with keeping the details intact. Do you feel that Sri Lankan men will like to
be bold with such a collection? Definitely, as Sri lanka has potential in men's fashion. A
lot of Sri Lankan men are experimenting with fashion and they believe in dressing up well.
What would be your pick from this collection? I'm really impressed with the bling ring
collection they have, as I am more of a ring person. Designer - Gitano Shirts Photographer

Feb 22 2019. This year Colombo Fashion Week will see the inclusion of three international
designers. Indian designers Rajesh Pratap Singh and Suket Dhir will be joined by Turkish
designer Cigdem Akin. Invited to show at CFW by Founder and CEO of CFW Ajai Vir Singh, the
trio of international designers will add their own flair to the runway shows. Billed as
one of India’s most well known fashion exports, designer Rajesh Pratap Singh is from the
Royal Rajput family of Rajasthan. Rajesh was encouraged to follow his father into the
field of medicine, but Rajesh who had taken a liking to fashion from a young age followed
his heart and went on to the NIFT in Delhi in 1994. After graduating from NIFT he spent a
couple of years training with Marzotto an Italian menswear label before launching his own
label in 96/97. Unlike his contemporaries, Rajesh favours clean contemporary silhouettes
and unlike his contemporaries he tends to avoid heavily embellished creations. His design
aesthetic is all about simple lines and minimalism which stems from his signature style
which he draws from his Indian roots. He is also passionate about Indian handlooms and
crafts which he uses extensively in his designs. Rajesh Pratap Singh’s achievements are
many. In 2009 he was awarded Designer of the Year by GQ India and in 2013 he was named a
Woolmark Ambassador. Hailing from Istanbul designer Cigdem Akin harboured an interest in
fashion since she was in school. A designer with over two decades of experience, Cigdem
worked for 16 years at Vakko before launching her own label Cigdem Akin. She favours
synthesizing clothes from east and west in her collections. Extraordinary cuts and
fabulous colour combinations ensure hers are timeless pieces. She sells around the world.
A regular at Istanbul Fashion Week since 2011, Cigdem has also shown at New York Manhattan
fashion show and participated in Paris Who’s Next Pret a Porter Fair. Tina Edward

Aug 09 2019. Fashion Fever descended on Colombo on day one of Olu Swim Week Colombo Luxury
Resort Wear when 7 designers took to the runway to showcase their collections. Brimming
with equal amounts of enthusiasm and talent, the seven designers displayed creativity and
versatility that bodes well for the future of fashion design of Sri Lanka. For the first
time ever, fashion and musicharmonalized on the runway as live musical performances by
local talents Amasha Tissera, Lasith Fernando and Q set the tune for this year's swim and
resort wear. “Today was Day 1 and we featured the best of young Sri Lankan talent in a
lovely new format in the form on live musical presentations on the runway. The last few
months have been challenging but the young talent has always persisted and that is exactly
what we showcased today. - Ajai Vir Singh, Founder and Managing Director of CFW ""Swim Week
expanded its scope to bring in the emerging designers segment to the Swim Week platform
and we saw an exceptional showcase of 7 young designers today. I'm really looking forward
to Day 2 at the magnificent Galle Face Hotel tomorrow, a brilliant line up on Day 3 at
Shangri La and an unforgettable tribute to Colombo on Sunday!"" - Fazeena Rajabdeen, CEO
and Director of CFW Marlon Rae Working diligently with little drama, the designer behind
the brand Maluba is on a course to become better with each passing show. Inspired by the
Rabbit in Alice in Wonderland, Marlon showcased a monochrome collection where the rabbit
was his leitmotif. Free flowing silhouettes in the form of shirt dresses and blousons were
teamed with one piece swimsuits. Himashi Wijeweera Beeralu featured heavily in this
collection which attempted to portray the three dimensional nature of this Sri Lankan
heritage craft which is enjoying a revival. Cutlawn cloth, linen and ombre silk were her
choice of fabrics. Ayesh Wickramaratne Making his second appearance in the emerging
designer segment, Ayesh presented a collection which showed off his draping skills.
Inspired by Chinese culture and architecture after a recent visit, Ayesh used colours of
red, yellow and beige to create ensembles which had asymmetrical hemlines. Merging
traditional with modernity his collection showed a streak of his ability to think out of
the box. Sheranja De Zoysa Inspired by her studies in architecture Sheranja attempted to
show the fragile beauty in what is broken. Her use of net fabric whish she paired with
burnt cotton provided an unusual element to her maiden collection. Nads Ratnayaka Staying
within the realm of her comfort zone, which is the use of embroidery, Nad’s collection was
inspired by the unity of Sri Lankan people. Using skeins in multi colours the intertwining
of embroidery stitches is meant to depict unity. Her fabric choices of crepe and linen
ensured easy free flowing silhouettes which complements most body shapes. Ridma
Samaranayake Working to a theme of peace and harmony, Ridma used the lotus flower as her
leitmotif which was splashed all across her collection. Her choice of white cotton fabric
was emblazoned with the lotus in gold foiling. Cowls and pleats added an extra dimension
to a collection of jumpsuits, dresses and kaftan tops. Nilusha Maddumage Inspired by the
concept of ‘relife’, Nilusha whose creative genius lies in her ability to drape fabric and
create unusual silhouettes presented a collection which had duality. Dresses morphed into
jumpsuits and skirts turned in to dresses with the clever use of zips, ties and buttons.
Closing the show on day one, her collection was a fitting finale. By: Tina Edward

life_fashion90_14_The_Uncle_Wardrobe_Top_05_style_mistakes_Sri_Lankan_Men_stil.pdf,"The Uncle Wardrobe: Top 05 style mistakes Sri Lankan Men still make today
May 21 2024. Do you ever ponder why men wear what they wear? And why is it that everyone
around them is too afraid to speak up and tell one of them their shirt’s sticking out of
their zip?? Men are such peculiar creatures. Sri Lankan men, even more so when it comes to
the way they dress. Since we live in an age where the way men clothe themselves and
present themselves to society dictates their level of success and social standing, I’d
like to take one for the team and address some of my pet peeves with the way Sri Lankan
men dress today so we can all move forward as a society. The ‘Purse’ by another name Let’s
take a moment to address the large wallet that seems to be trending with Sri Lankan men
right now. While everywhere else in the world the physical wallet seems to be shrinking in
width and volume thanks to digital solutions, Middle Sri Lanka seems to have promoted the
idea that things that don’t even fit in our back pockets should be a thing. Was it because
there was an international brand suddenly making its bulkier female counterpart quite
popular? I say enough! A slim bi-fold wallet or card carrier with RFID protection should
be enough to hold your essential cards and change. Pick one and free the weight from your
bulging pocket. Anything but that. Unintentionally oversized clothing As men get on with
age, there tends to be a choice one makes whether the shirt fits your collar or your
waist. Any other proportion the shirt needs to adhere to happens to get ignored;
especially on those short sleeves that go past your elbow. Or pants that are about a foot
of fabric crumpled up at your ankles. As much as I appreciate how there is a trend for
oversized clothing right now, everyone can notice how you might not be because of the
trend. Consider taking the time to have your recently purchased pants and shirts (even
t-shirts) taken to some tailor and altered for a better fit. Six out of ten times it would
help reduce your perceived age by a decade or two and make you five times more attractive.
The tucking conundrum and other innerwear sins I get it. Your shirt tends to move out or
stuff out as you move about your day. I even understand the hassle of maintaining that
perfect balance of tucked-in and pulled-out that gives you the tapered look you want, but
I cannot condone tucking your shirt into your boxers/briefs. Or seeing a vest poke out
from your button line, or white socks with black shoes on a grown man in an office. Or
full socks with a pair of loafers (slip-on shoes). These are all taboo. Not even the 80s
want to forgive you. In the case of long-sleeved shirts, consider the sleeved vest an
option to stop you from sweating through your shirt. The sleeveless vest (a.k.a Baniyan)
should be the best fit for solving the same problem with short-sleeved shirts or tees. And
no man out of school should need to wear white socks with his corporate or formal outfits.
I feel like some men have also taken the horror one step further by wearing white ankle
socks now with athletic stripes on them. If it’s titled office socks, probably best to
wear them to the office, isn’t it? Matchy Matchy I don’t know truly how it started, but
Sri Lanka has pioneered the monochromatic look, especially in couples. It’s great when
it’s once in a while; not when it’s a lifestyle. If colours are too hard to understand,
maybe one item in your outfit (i.e. your shoes and your shirt) can be similar or close but
contrasts also work. Never go for a full outfit in one colour as a man unless you have the
‘confidence’ to deal with any comments regarding it. Generally keeping them in the same
tonal (cool/warm/neutral/pastel/jewel) values should allow them to mix well, but if you’re
not sure just ask someone. Even if it is your mother. Get with the times, and get rid of
the fraying edges Don’t you just hate that most men’s fashion is still somewhat stuck in
the 90s or 80s, or at least some men’s sensibilities are? With retailers and advertising
trying really hard to change that, it doesn’t help that mainstream media promotes these
fashion caricatures from yesteryear with their characterisation of everyday Sri Lankans
dressed in black pants and ‘bush’ shirts. I think it’s great to have a sense of style
inspired by an iconic period of our fashion history, especially if you are a maturegentleman still making strides socially. What I do not condone is having no thought behind
it, and seeing men in actual bell-bottom pants. Also if you have any items fraying at the
edges, or too faded to make out – they are not vintage, they are garbage and need to be
replaced. Unless you’re talking about classic rock t-shirts or clothes like denim items
that were made to stand the test of time. A fashion stylist with a decade of experience as

Mar 29 2018. What: Colombo Fashion Week Where: Hilton Colombo When: 19th March to 25th
March Colombo Fashion Week celebrated it's 15th year on the runway, ending with the treat
of the master of drapes, Tarun Tahiliani on the final day. What a Sunday it was, with the
audience's whispered chorus of ' ooohhs ' and ' ahhhs '. This year began with Art Connect,
which featured some phenomenal local artists at a location that is a diamond in the rough,
the Laksala building in Fort. CFW Day 1 from the main shows closed with Aslam Hussain. For
that night my favourites were U by Upeksha, and La'Sari by Nilanka. Nilanka's inspiration
had come from the colourful Holi festival. On a side note, if you are working with tie and
dye and fabric as your forte, stick to cloth making and not dressmaking . It was as though
someone tied me and I then died Day 2 started off with Parisian Haute Couture designer,
Eymeric François, who's collection was an inspired start to the day. It also featured one
of the quirkiest brands that had become a real trendsetter, The Old Railway. Catherine
Rawson's TOR, comes to life as she sips her tea overlooking the Galle ramparts that are
now her home. A few designers were able to steal the show that night; Lovi made a strong
presence and put sarongs on the map once again. I was happy to see Indi back on the CFW
cat walk , after a small hiatus, where her inspiration for this year came from the
bohemian world. The closing that night was literally the cherry on the top of an already
amazing show. Sonali Dharmawardena's collection left an impression as the artist found her
canvas on the cat walk . Day 3 had everyone speaking about Dimuthu all night long. He
succeeded in maintaining the momentum of his collection from start to finish. It had two
men's designers who were featured that night. FH who played around with the blue's and
Conscience who played around with the black and the white. Although Bibi Russell, who I
love and admire said, 'I put this collection together so quickly', there is something
about her work that leaves everyone wanting more. Buddi Batik brought in the swag
promoting peace and harmony and Sharini nailed it with her self-created fabric. Day 3 also
had someone who played only with whites, Hemant Trivedi, who used simple fabric but worked
with brilliant appliques. Day 4 had two seatings, where the emerging designers got their
spot to shine. They closed with the one and only Tarun Tahiliani. This year, the fashion I
saw “off” the runway could have done with some help! If you are invited next year, get a
look put together Photograph retouched by – You're my Favorite Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a

life_fashion90_15_Amesh_Wijesekera_at_Berlin_Fashion_Week.pdf,"Amesh Wijesekera at Berlin Fashion Week
Jan 22 2019. One of Sri Lanka’s brightest fashion prospect Amesh Wijesekera is the talk of
Berlin because his AW19 ‘Dream me’ collection injected an explosion of colour into a
dreary January Berlin emerging from the clutches of a bleak winter. Creamy pale golds,
crimson, tangerine, ochre, rust and burnished bronzes lent an air of vibrancy to the
runway, transporting the audience to an exotic and vibrant destination. A world away from
Berlin. Colour, texture and more colour in rich textiles were used, clashing different
elements to make bold statements. This collection hadAmesh written all over it as it was
something fresh while conveying nuances of rawness. Born in London and educated in
Colombo, Amesh is a graduate of the AOD, one of Sri Lanka’s finest design schools which
has a knack of creating some fine young designers. He rose to prominence when his graduate
collection which he showcased at Mercedes Benz Fashion Runway in Sri Lanka won him an
award which paved the way for him to show at Graduate Fashion Week London International
Catwalk competition in 2016 prior to taking part in the Fashion Scout at LFW in 2017. He
has also completed apprenticeships with Edeline Lee and Zandra Rhodes who is also known
for her love and use of vibrant colours. Flitting between London and Colombo Amesh loves
collaborations especially between local artisans who weave his bright fabrics. He brings
his design knowledge and the weavers their technical expertise. With both working in
unison it is a marriage made in creative heaven. “ I sit with the weavers and I like to
involve them as much as possible because they have so much experience in the craft,
whereasa I think I bring more of the design knowledge and we can see how we canb use the
two” he explains. Of this collaborative process he says “ I’m learning, they are learning,
we’re both learning” Witha wisdom that belies his young age, Amesh’s design philosophy is
the combine the physical and emotional elements of clothes. For him the process of
creating is of great importance. This he considers to be the most exciting part of his
designs. The launch of Amesh’s AW19 collection saw him present a “trans seasonal’
collection of clothing that can be styled in any way. It represents the aesthetic of his
label which is a juxtaposition of the world and the energies around him. The collections
contains a mix of statement and accessible pieces which has something for everyone. They
are bold pieces in simple silhouettes and the creative use of colour makes it a visually
arresting collection in addition to having many practical pieces which can be worn in any
part of the world. Photos: MercedesBenFashion and Moeez Moeez Ali Tina Edward Gunawardhana

life_fashion90_15_Buzz_with_Danu_Dishnira_Saparamadu_-_Ariyarathne.pdf,"Buzz with Danu: Dishnira Saparamadu - Ariyarathne
Jul 17 2024. Today on the Buzz I speak to a very talented and enthusiastic person, who is
always on the go and ever so willing to see the best come out of any situation. Dishnira
Saparamadu - Ariyarathne has this amazing power in organising, taking charge and finding
the strength to lead by example, be it her wedding or details with her brand, Dishnira
always showed amazing leadership and courage. Together with her partner in crime (Husband
Shehan), she has created a space for local creativity and design to take centrestage at
Thambili Island and it’s nice to see a true, authentic brand taking life and going strong.
She speaks to me on the Buzz about what makes her who she is :) 1. What made you start
your journey with Thambili Island? In 2018, after graduating from university in the UK, I
moved back to Sri Lanka and began working as a business analyst. Despite my career, my
passion for fashion was always present. I wanted to create a local brand that resonated
with Sri Lankans, offering great outfits that boost confidence. Initially, we started with
resort wear only, but seeing the positive response, we expanded into a broader range of
island styles. This passion led to the birth of Thambili Island, a brand rooted in our
local culture but inspired by global fashion. 2. Did you ever feel you have this element
of design in you? Yes, I’ve always felt a strong pull towards design. Growing up, I was
really into arts and crafts projects, especially scrapbooking. My dream was to own a
stationery boutique like Paper Market in Singapore, where I would spend hours on end. This
love for creativity translated into my passion for fashion. I’ve always known I wanted to
be in a creative field, so starting ThambiliIsland was something I was incredibly excited
about. Turning this passion into a fulfilling career has been an amazing journey. 3. You
are qualified in accounting & finance and shifting to a creative field was it hard, or was
this your calling always? It was always my calling. There were definitely difficulties in
building a brand from scratch, but it felt much more natural to me than accounting and
finance. Graduating at 19 with a bachelor’s degree, I was eager to take risks and explore
my true passion. At 21, I dove into Thambili Island, and while the first two years were a
steep learning curve, I found the journey incredibly rewarding. My degree helped me
navigate the business side, and I’m so happy with how it all turned out. 4. Your brand has
always celebrated our women, what was the thinking when you were growing your business?
The core idea was to celebrate and empower women by creating outfits that boost
confidence. I wanted Thambili Island to be inclusive, offering designs that cater to
different body types. Whether it’s the neckline or the length of the dress, every detail
is designed to enhance the wearer’s image and make them feel like the goddess they are. 5.
What inspires you to do what you do? I am inspired by the vibrant culture of Sri Lanka,
the strength of the women around me, and the power of a great outfit to boost confidence.
The joy of creating something that makes someone feel beautiful and confident keeps me
motivated. I am constantly pushing my creative boundaries and stepping out of my comfort
zone to explore new ideas and designs. 6. How would you describe an empowered woman? An
empowered woman is confident, embraces her uniqueness, and uses her strength to uplift
others. She is resilient and fearless, ready to break boundaries and embrace her true
self. Thambili Island is all about bringing out the inner goddess in every woman. 7. A
book that changed your life? My father gave me this book, ""Power of Your Subconscious
Mind"" by Joseph Murphy. This book profoundly impacted me by highlighting the incredible
potential of positive thinking and the subconscious mind. It has guided me through
personal and professional challenges, helping me stay focused on my goals. 8. What would
you tell the youth of today in Sri Lanka? Pursue your passions with confidence and believe
in your abilities. The youth of today have the power to drive positive change. Embrace
innovation, take risks, and remember that your unique perspective is invaluable. You can
create a bright future for yourself and contribute significantly to our country. 9. As acountry we have a huge Brain Drain, what would you tell those who want to leave this
island home? While exploring opportunities abroad is beneficial, remember the immense
potential within Sri Lanka. Your skills and talents are needed here, and you can make a
significant impact. Consider how you can contribute to the growth and development of our
beautiful island home. 10. What’s next for the brand? This year, Thambili Island is
excited to expand its product range and explore more collaborations with South Asian
artisans, delving deeper into South Asian culture. We are hoping to expand beyond working
solely with our Sri Lankan artisan communities to embrace the rich heritage and
craftsmanship of the broader South Asian region. We have some very cool collaborations
coming up that will highlight this incredible artistry. Our goal remains to bring ethical,
beautiful fashion to a broader audience while empowering our community and staying true to
our core values of inclusivity, ingenuity, and community empowerment. 11. How would you
describe your perfect day? My perfect day starts with a cappuccino made by my bestie, my
husband, and some morning catch-up time before heading to work. I'm fortunate to work with
him, so we see each other a lot during the day. I’d also try to sneak in a workout. Going
to the boutique is incredibly rewarding; I love working with our amazing teams and meeting
our customers. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a Marketing qualification (only because he needed

life_fashion90_15_Designer_1-2-1_Gihan_Ediriweera.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Gihan Ediriweera
Jan 16 2018. The undisputed King of tie and dye batik in Sri Lanka is designer Gihan
Ediriweera. His love for tie and dye started when he did a small workshop and through a
series of fortuitous events he has made his name in this niche. Gihan also won the
Designer of the Year award in 2009 which really set him off on his long journey in Sri
Lanka’s fashion industry. A regular at Colombo Fashion Week, Gihan is seen as a creative
designer who can create exciting fabrics and silhouettes. What made you embark on a career
in fashion? I love fashion and arts and I am born with that. I was attached to apparel
industry to for two decades and my career was in merchandising/product development area.
At that time fashion was apart time job which I now do as a full-time job Name of the
label? G by Gihan Ediriweera Why do you have an affiliation to tie and dye? It is a long
story which is difficult to explain in few lines but somehow it happened and now I love it
and I have built my image with Tie and dye and no escape. What is your latest collection
called? Desert Safari Describe this new collection? It was made on a request by Kelaniya
University for their event and I was given a theme to work on. How long have you been a
designer for? since 2009 October What inspired this collection? Everything about the
desert What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri Lanka?
Oh..not easy. Many people still don't understand the meaning of designer wear and
handcrafted products.Also the market is flooded with a lot of imported products at cheaper
prices so people tend to buy low cost products or they always tend to compare our products
with them. Where do you retail your stuff? Direct sales, Online and Ramp-art in Gallefort
What is your top fashion tip? Simplicity and less is more concept Fashion prediction for
next season? Layering, frills will still continue. Watercolour feeling and shadings will
make it more dramatic. Who would you like seeing dressed in your creations? Young men and
women who admire handcrafted artistic pieces Which designers/brands are you influenced by?
Not a specific one. Any design who work from textile (tie-dye , batik , hand loom) to
garments I admire.Because there are few designers in our country who has a knowledge and
capable of producing their on textile and their design process start at the textile stage
itself and I respect that. What’s the best way to accessorize your clothes - it depends
based on the product but I think ethnic wear will be more suitable Tina Edward

Mar 13 2018. Miosis is a relatively new label that has been on the Sri Lankan fashion
scene for the last two years. Its founder Prithi McLeod has her boutique in Colombo which
has a varied collection of ready to wear dresses and separates. A fashion designer who has
worked in Australia, Prithi returned to her native Sri Lanka with a vision to opening her
own boutique which has been achieved. Her new collection is called Mix Match and has been
inspired by pajamas. What made you embark on a career in fashion? My mother taught me
sewing from a young age, where I made designed and made garments for myself and family. I
soon found others requesting my designs and so decided to pursue a career in fashion when
I moved to Australia. What is your latest collection called? mix match Describe this new
collection Contemporary classic designs with a modern twist that speak to the soul. How
long have you been a designer for? I have over 15 years of experience in leading wholesale
and retail brands in Australia and for the last two years I have been working on my own
brand What inspired this collection? PJ-inspired pieces are easy to wear and the best way
to look like you didn’t try too hard. The key is how you style it. You can wear sleepwear
with a pair of sneakers and accessorize it; that’s how you can transform sleepwear into
daywear in the chicest of ways. What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion
business in Sri Lanka? Fashion in Sri Lanka is difficult because the market is small and
many customers seek French Couture styles with personnel fit at ready to wear prices.
Where do you retail your stuff? All the new stock is available at our shop at 96 Kynsey Rd
Colombo 7, Odel stocks our clothing range, Cotton Collection our sleepwear and some items
will soon be available on Amazon. Who is your muse? Because of my strong sense of self and
love of fashion and beautiful things I have been my own muse. Fashion prediction for next
season? We will see lots of disturbed pastel colours Who would you like seeing dressed in
your creations? Stylish Modern women Which designers/brands are you influenced by? I am
influenced by my own sense of style and I wear what makes me feel comfortable and
confident. I am also not limited to any design or brand. Why do you think sleepwear is an
important aspect of one’s wardrobe? Because you should look good, feel confident, relaxed
and comfortable even in sleep and loungewear in the bedroom or house so that the wearer is
in the best frame of mind to accomplish anything.if you look good, you feel good and can
do anything you set your mind to. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

life_fashion90_15_Designer_1-21_Thilini_Silva.pdf,"Designer 1-21 Thilini Silva
Apr 01 2019. Young designer Thilini Silva recently launched her new collection at PR. A
graduate from the AOD Thilini is the proud owner of her label TSS. Thilini is a talented
designer who is blessed with a creative eye. Her latest collection featured art work
inspired by Sri Lankan artist Laki Senanayake. Thilini is partial to creating her own
fabric designs and given her artistic inclination it seems an entirely sensible option.
Her silhouettes are simple but stylish and her colour palette provides her collection
with nuances of sophistication. What made you embark on a career in fashion? Ever since I
remember I've always tagged along with my mother when hunting for fabric. I feel like I am
a kid in a candy store when I enter a fabric store and my mind gets filled with ideas. I
also enjoy being in my mother’s workshop watching the process. While helping out I
realised this is what I enjoy doing; experimenting and getting my hands dirty and taking
risks to make someone feel confident and beautiful. I have considered other careers like
architecture and I've visited sites and gone though my father's work but my love has
always been towards fashion design. Describe this new collection? This is a collection
that represents Sri Lanka from how I see it, The hidden greenery we see everyday and a
slight touch of minimalism. For silhouettes, I've played around with volume and shape in a
trendy and versatile way to bring comfort to the wearer with fabrics like pure silks,
crepe silks and cotton silks and used them in a way where there is less wastage. I have
also used fabric hand painted with cotton dyes inspired by the ""Pen & Ink by Sri Lankan
artist Laki Senanayaka What inspired this collection? My surroundings, I was going though
my dad's old work and found these beautiful pen sketches by Laki Senanayaka and a few
other artists which I then thought why not use them for a collection so we can all
appreciate the art and heritage of our country. As a young designer What are the
challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri Lanka? Colombo is a very small
society compared to the big world out there so I'd say catering to a niche market can be a
challenge. Also keeping up with the standards. When it comes to patterns we lack
experience and practicality which will improve with time and fabric usage not knowing the
exact amount at time… but I am thankful I have my mum around as I often find her advice
invaluable. Where do you retail your stuff? I'm retailing at PR a Fashion Design Concept
store in, Colombo What is your top fashion tip? I would say comfort but you only live once
so take the risk and try it out what ever it is when it comes to fashion. Who is your
muse? Tilda Swinton and Jenifer Lawrence, completely different characters but I admire
both. Fashion prediction for next season? Luminous colours, back deconstructive couture
and lace What is fashion no no ? Padded shoulders. I am also not a fan of square toes but
although I think it's come out well this time, it still a no no for me Who would you like
seeing dressed in your creations? I would say anyone that wants a bit of confidence .
Because it feels good to be dressed in silk that's hand painted.. and I've used colours
that would complement any skin tone. Which designers / brands are you influenced by? Dior,
Alexander McQueen, Valentino and Zimmerman are just a few. The list is endless. What’s the
best way to accessorise your clothes? I'd say something minimal, comfy leather sandals or
even sneakers or for the evening in a pair of heels. A leather handbag a little pouch
something that keeps the feel. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

life_fashion90_15_Fashionably_Danu_-_La_Ceyloné.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu - La Ceyloné
Jun 29 2021. On Fashionably Danu I feature the very famous La Ceyloné shirt brand which
changed the island vibe in our country. With the streetwear boom over the past years, the
humble “flower power” shirts have also had something of a glow-up. This is a season for
shirts which doesn’t feel too tight around your neck or even on your body, and considering
the fact that we are working from home, it's cool to be in something that is breathable.
The all-new La Ceyloné has really taken the flower power shirts to the next level, with
clean cuts, amazing stitch and the fabric is just so comfy for our ever-so-confusing
weather. Give it a try and now you can just order online. Today I speak to the hard-
working man who has kept this brand alive with an amazing vision which you will get to see
soon. 1. What made La Ceylon é take a break in the market? It's the overall lifestyle
break with the covid situation. We are still waiting for the main resort campaign to come
out with normality! Gradually we are also resuming in other parts of the world. It's a
very tricky situation to promote an outgoing resort culture! 2. Floral shirt concept
became very common, how do you hope to stand out? The florals need to evolve into more
designer signature ranges and we love to focus more on the La Ceyloné story going deep
into Sri Lankan roots, that's our common ground, the new personality flavour the world
needs to taste. An exciting project in the making! 3. Tell me about the looks you have
featured on me today? We want to keep the tropical-floral appetite fresh, so here we have
new colours in a smart casual cut for tropical lovers. 4. The cut is what makes a shirt
stand out, how did you work on the blocks and would you say this shirt is nice fitted or
relaxed? A shirt's technical construction is the key! La Ceyloné personality is always
relaxed fitted but extremely fashion conscious so depending on the occasion you can always
style it! 5. This collection the designs are very island-inspired and new, how has the
process been creating these designs? It's the idea to bring the next step of tropicals,
introduce fresh colours and establish the La Ceyloné basic range. 6. What are the other
options you hope to add to the label? We are looking at the entire La Ceyloné lifestyle
product range - especially for men! Limited editions for women. 7. How has the online
market been, especially with a lockdown? It's tough with ethically we want people to stay
safe and focus on what's essential for them, but then there's always the La Ceyloné fan
base! 8. What's next for the brand? We can't wait to launch our official La Ceyloné resort
campaign! 9. What according to you is your favourite part of being In this industry? It's
to see people embrace these lifestyles, what once was an idea sketch on a notebook. 10.
Will this range be available at any local outlets or only online? This collection will be
only available on our website for now - WWW.LACEYLONE.COM Instagram: la.ceylone Designer -

to represent Sri Lanka at the main pageant which will be held in China later this year.
The judges for the evening were film director and screenwriter Bennett Rathnayake,
beautician, entrepreneur and grooming instructress Wena Goeiyana, Founder/CEO Nalaka H
Consulting Inc., Nalaka Hewamadduma, Mrs Singapore Universe 2011 Kenny Santika and master
stylist Gerald Solomons. The pageant was choreographed by veteran designer and
choreographer Senaka De Silva. The splendour of the Indian Ocean was highlighted in the
opening performance by the Channa- Upuli Performing Arts Foundation. This performance
accompanied the resort wear parade with all 11 designs done by renowned batik artist Eric
Suriyasena. Performances by Voice Print and the Channa- Upuli dancers added much glamour
to the evening. The air was quite competitive as each finalist had a talent of their own.
As the winners of the mini pageants were announced, the audience moved to the edge of
their seats as they started guessing who the winner would be. The winners of the mini
pageants are as follows; Miss Congeniality: Rumali Gamage Kiss Miss Popular: Dilakxi
Anthony Facia Most Beautiful Skin: Rumali Gamage Fadna Body Beautiful: Nilushi Pawanya
Denta Most Beautiful Smile: Rumali Gamage Offmarks Face of the Year: Uthpala Dissanayake
Miss Sports and fitness: Nilushi Pawanya LICC Model of the year: Nadia Gyi Singer Miss
Talent: Keshi Fernando Aliya Resorts and Spa Dances of Sri Lanka: Dilakxi Anthony Triumph
Miss Confidence: Nadia Gyi As the evening drew towards its most crucial moment the
contestants walked the ramp for one last time in their elegant evening wear dresses
designed by Charith Wijesekara before the names of the top five contestants were revealed.
Nilushi Pawanya and Peshala Wijesundara were sashed as the second and the first runner up
respectively while Nadia Gyi walked away with an elegant, custom-made crown designed by
Raja Jewellers when she was crowned Facia Miss World Sri Lanka 2018. As the evening drew
to an end we spoke to the winners, judges and guests who shared their views: “I think we
had a very good set of girls. Some of them were raw at the beginning but we managed to get
them all to one level. The judgement was good. We gave them all the technical training and
in the end they faced it well.” – Choreographer Senaka “I’m really excited and I didn’t
expect it. It has been an amazing journey and I wish Nadia all the best.”- Peshala
Wijesundara, First runner up “How I feel right now is absolutely indescribable. I think
all the hard work paid off and I’m very excited. I have one month to prepare for the main
pageant and I will make use of it and definitely try to bring the crown home.” - Nadia
Gyi, Winner “We all have a competition in life and this experience gave me a chance to
improve myself. I hope that I can use this title to achieve my dream of becoming an
actress.” - Nilushi Pawanya - Second Runner Up “Firstly I want to thank the organizers for
inviting me for this pageant as a judge. During the judging process we had so much fun.
The winner deserves the title and I wish her all the best.” - Wena “I feel that all the
girls had a good confidence in them. During the competition, they have learned from
different experts and therefore they were groomed to be stronger women from the pageant
itself.”- Bennett “All the girls were really smart and all of them wanted to give their
best. They had a competition with themselves rather than with one another. They accepted
the winner without a problem. We all looked at a person who could represent Sri Lanka and
I think Nadia is capable of it. Her project too is quite amazing. All 11 girls were
talented and they will hopefully start a career from now onwards.” - Nalaka “It’s good to
see how they grow and improve themselves throughout the pageant. Doesn’t matter who winsor loses it’s all about how they face the show.”- Kushlani “We have come a long way in
terms of the beauty pageant industry. It has gained recognition among the public. When I
represented Sri Lanka back in 2002 at Mr. World and other pageants it was quite difficult
to find sponsors. So today we see a difference and it’s a good sign for this industry in
Sri Lanka. But we need to improve in terms of grooming and other areas in order to be in
par with other countries.” – Roshan “I think the contestants faced the event very well.
When looking at all the pageants happening in Sri Lanka I think this pageant is the best.
Today’s judgement was fair as well. They did their best and it will raise the bar for the
pageants that will be organised in Sri Lanka.” - Chulpadmendra “All the girls faced the
pageant well. Their presentations were good and they scored more on their personality
rather than only the looks.” - Menik “The concept and the production was good. This is the
best pageant out of all pageants as Sangeetha, Dhananjaya and Shereen have contributed
their maximum for its success. It’s a good opportunity for all girls in Sri Lanka to
expose themselves to the rest of the world in a professional manner.” - Suraj Pics by

life_fashion90_15_Redress_Design_Award_2022_-_Top_10_designers_advance_to_the.pdf,"Redress Design Award 2022 - Top 10 designers advance to the runway
May 17 2022. Redress, the environmental NGO working to reduce fashion’s waste, announces
today the 10 finalists of the Redress Design Award 2022, the world’s largest sustainable
fashion design competition, supported by Create Hong Kong (CreateHK) of the Government of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region as the lead sponsor. The finalists,
representing eight different regions worldwide and selected by an international panel of
industry-leading judges, will be bringing their competition designs to life in time for
the Grand Final Fashion Presentation in Hong Kong in mid-September, where the winners will
be announced. Textile waste is a global environmental and economic concern, with more than
50% of fast fashion clothes discarded within one year. Designing sustainable fashion
requires a combination of creativity and innovation, with consideration for the source
material, the impact of manufacturing and usage, and products’ recyclability at their end
of life. This year’s finalists sought out unique waste streams to create their
collections, including hotel bed sheets, kimono, obi silks, and damaged deadstock knitted
collars. Many of the finalists also employed zero-waste patterns and other circular design
techniques to further enhance the sustainability of their designs. The educational journey
was undertaken by Redress Design Award contestants also proved its merit as three of its
alumni – former semi-finalists — re-applied this year, earning places as finalists. “The
contestants have been demonstrating new dimensions of colours, forms, and styles, while
embracing sustainable practices. We can definitely see the next-gen game-changers are
striving for a better future,” says Angus Tsui, one of the judges, who is also Creative
Director of his eponymous brand and an alumnus of the Redress Design Award. Career-
changing prizes are on offer for the top finalists, including a sustainable design
collaboration with VF Corporation’s Timberland team and a development fund of HK$50,000
(US$6,400) for the first prize winner. Collectively, the finalists’ works demonstrate the
power that designers have to transform waste. “As the fashion industry emerges into a
post-pandemic world, there is a renewed sense of urgency and commitment to sustainable
production,” says Nissa Cornish, Executive Director of Redress. “These forward-thinking
designers are part of this shift in transforming how we make and use fashion, and it is an
honour to support their journey and showcase their talents.” In addition to sustainability
and creativity, to become finalists, the 10 designers were also judged on criteria such as
marketability and scalability, with international judge Orsola de Castro, fashion designer
and co-founder of Fashion Revolution, noting that, “When you juxtapose beautiful hand
finishing to a deliberately upcycled product, it can look amazing! But it has to sing.”
Another judge, Chief Operating Officer of TAL Apparel Christophe Degoix, says, “Promoting
sustainable products is critical to the future of the apparel industry and those young
designers across the world are showing us the way.” Next up, the 10 finalists will send
their completed collections — including four physical looks and one digital outfit — to
Hong Kong for a professional photo shoot, with the garments to be safely delivered via
UPS’ carbon neutral shipping. In the lead-up to the Grand Final Fashion Presentation, the
designers will also be demonstrating their zero-waste and upcycling skills through
practical challenges tasked by industry leaders. The Redress Design Award 2022 Finalists
are: Ashutosh Panda, India Cris Miranda, Chile Drina Marco, Spain Federico Badini
Confalonieri, Italy Lívia Aguiar de Castro, Brazil Micaela Clubourg, Spain Mohammed Numaan
Khan, India Nawoda Bandara, Sri Lanka Patrick Lam, Hong Kong, China Ruwanthi Gajadeera,
Sri Lanka PUBLIC VOTES FOR ‘PEOPLE’S CHOICE’ FINALIST The public were instrumental in
selecting one of the 10 finalists, who automatically advanced to the finalist round by
receiving the most votes. The winner of the People’s Choice Award 2022, Cris Miranda of
Chile, will present their collection alongside the nine other emerging sustainable fashion
talents at the Grand Final in Hong Kong in mid-September 2022. Your comment (*)",4365
life_fashion90_15_Spreading_Social_Messages_Through_Batik_Fusion_14.pdf,"Spreading Social Messages Through Batik: Fusion 14
Jul 18 2023. Saarah Dean Ismail, the founder of Fusion 14 is on a mission to use the
artisanal craft of batik to spread social messages. Working with a team of artisans Saarah
has created what is possibly Sri Lanka’s tallest batik tapestry which could be best
described as a pennant sans its customary tapered edge. This creation inspired by Deen’s
passion to safeguard the island’s rich cultural heritage and lend support to vital
environmental conservation efforts was on display at One Galle Face over a period of a few
days and garnered much interest. In the long term Deen’s hope is that this work of art can
be a permanent fixture for people to be inspired by. Q What made you create what is
possibly the longest batik decorative art? Inspired by the exquisite heritage of batik and
its intricately woven patterns, I envisioned a piece that would transcend conventional
boundaries and make a lasting impact in the art world. In pushing the limits of batik art,
my intention extended far beyond personal celebration. I aspired to ignite a spark of
inspiration within others, urging them to boldly explore and redefine artistic norms.
Moreover, this extraordinary artwork represented an embodiment of Fusion14’s unwavering
commitment to addressing pressing environmental challenges. The canvas I chose went beyond
being a mere artistic creation; it became a powerful tool for spreading awareness about a
cause that deeply resonated with the brand’s ethos: the plight of animal extinction and
deforestation. It was a heartfelt endeavour, driven by a genuine passion to safeguard Sri
Lanka’s rich cultural heritage and lend support to vital environmental conservation
efforts. Q How long did you take to complete this? The creation of this Batik Tapestry,
from the initial design phase to the final production, took approximately 40 days to
complete. Q How many people were involved in creating this? A team of 21 individuals,
including artisans, sewing experts, the design team, the drawing team, and various other
contributors, collaborated to create this Batik Tapestry. Each member played a crucial
role in bringing the artwork to life. Q What was the inspiration behind this? The
inspiration behind the creation of this Batik Tapestry stemmed from two main sources: the
exquisite heritage art of batik and Fusion14’s commitment to sustainability and addressing
social issues. Q What is the social message the artwork is conveying? The artwork of the
Batik Tapestry carries a powerful social message focused on the themes of animal
extinction and deforestation. The tapestry has been meticulously crafted using 36 by
36-inch squares, ingeniously arranged in 4 columns and 30 rows, resulting in a total of
120 squares. Each square represents a work of art in itself, depicting various elements
related to the theme, such as endangered wildlife species, the significance of plants
found in the Sinharaja rainforest, and other symbolic representations related to the
threats faced by our natural environment. Q After the display at One Galle Face what will
you do with this? Our goal is to find a suitable museum or institution where the batik
tapestry can be appreciated and valued for its artistic significance. We are currently in
discussions with potential venues to determine the best fit for this remarkable piece. Q
How important is it to you personally to promote social causes through fashion and design?
Promoting social causes through fashion and design is deeply fulfilling, as it allows me
to merge my passion for creativity with a purpose-driven approach. It is my personal
commitment to leave a positive imprint on the world and contribute to building a more
sustainable and inclusive future. Q As a champion of batik what steps are you taking to
ensure this craft will continue? Ensuring the continuity of batik is deeply personal to
me. Firstly, we have a team of local artisans and batik experts who possess invaluable
knowledge and skills. By providing them with a platform to showcase their craft, we not
only support their livelihoods but also encourage the preservation of traditional
techniques. We host workshops and events, our most recent event at One Galle Face also had
a live batik station, to educate both the younger generation and the wider community aboutthe significance and beauty of batik. By fostering a deeper appreciation for this art
form, we inspire individuals to become custodians of batik and contribute to its
continuity. Furthermore, we are continuously exploring innovative ways to incorporate
batik into contemporary fashion and design. By blending traditional aesthetics with modern
trends, we aim to make batik more accessible and appealing to a wider audience, ensuring
its relevance and longevity. Q What are the sustainability credentials of this piece? This
Batik Tapestry embodies sustainability through various aspects of its creation,
particularly in the batik process itself. During the dyeing and rinsing stages, efforts
were made to minimise water usage. Water-saving techniques and practices were employed to
reduce the overall water footprint of the batik process. Furthermore, the production of
the Batik Tapestry incorporated energy-efficient practices, such as utilising natural
light and optimising equipment usage. The batik process focused on minimising waste
generation. Techniques such as recycling and reusing dye baths, and proper disposal of
chemical waste were employed to reduce the overall waste footprint. Lastly, The
sustainable aspects of this piece extend beyond the materials and techniques used. By
providing a platform for local artisans and supporting their livelihoods, the tapestry
contributes to the social sustainability and economic wellbeing of the community. Tina

life_fashion90_15_Vikum_Rajapakse_and_Nadishan_Shanthikumar_-_the_duo_behind_K.pdf,"Vikum Rajapakse and Nadishan Shanthikumar - the duo behind Kantala
Aug 21 2017. Producing handbags that conform to ethical and fair trade practices is the
forte of entrepreneurs Vikum and Nadishan. Exiting the corporate world to embark on a
career that fulfils their dreams has seen this duo launch Kantala - a hip and fashion
savvy brand. Name of fashion school? We don’t have a formal education from a fashion
school. We did our own reading, speaking to people already in the industry and learning by
trial and error. By all means, this wasn’t a comprehensive education in fashion. We have a
wealth of experience working in the corporate world. What made you embark on a career in
fashion? We always had an ambition of founding our own venture and we wanted it to be
something that helps promote Sri Lanka. We felt that Sri Lanka has more to offer than
being just a manufacturing destination for global fashion brands. We identified a village
outside of Kandy which has an indigenous craft of weaving using sustainably sourced plant
fibre. Having communicated our ambitions with the artisans, we decided to start an ethical
fashion accessory brand through which we promote Sri Lanka’s waning craft of weaving and
also be the platform to empower and support our traditional artisans. Name of label? Our
brand is called ‘Kantala’ and is named after the Sanskrit word of the Hana plant – which
yields the core material used to create all our products. The Hana plant (Agave cantala)
is a sustainable plant with a signature rosette of thick leaves which can reach up to two
metres in length. The leaves are scraped to extract a fine fibre, which is used to weave
all the mats used in our Kantala products. The handwoven natural fibre mat is a
sustainable alternative to animal based leather. PU and rexine materials, while vegan, are
hugely detrimental to the environment as they are synthetics which don’t decompose. The
handwoven mat also exudes an aura of luxury and sophistication making it a credible
alternative to animal based leathers. What is your latest collection called? Tropical
Hues. Describe this new collection? This collection has a lot of bright and bold colours
and is ideal to add a pop of colour when styling an outfit. It includes totes, a few
versions of clutch bags and wallets. We’ve also made a conscious effort to make the
products more functional. All materials used in this collection have been sustainably
sourced and the collection is PETA Approved Vegan. The core material which is the natural
handwoven hana mat is complemented with Fair Trade guaranteed handloom, Pinatex (a
pineapple fibre based alternative to leather) and upcycled coconut shell logos. How long
have you been a designer for? Since starting Kantala, all the product designs have been
done by us. However, we don’t think we can be called ‘designers’ as neither of us have a
background in this area. What inspired this collection? It’s a collection which is
inspired by Sri Lanka’s natural beauty (sunsets, beaches, mountain ranges) and the
colourful personalities of our people. The silhouettes are classic yet sleek and sharp.
What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri Lanka? In our case
we pay a lot of attention to areas such of sourcing materials that don’t harm our planet
or people and timely and fair wages to our artisans. However, we feel that the demand from
Sri Lankan consumers who are willing to pay a fair price for an ethically made product is
low at the moment. Also, given the unique nature of the materials we use for our products,
it has been challenging to find manufacturers who have the skill, technology and
motivation to meet our quality expectations. Where do you retail your stuff? Our latest
collection is available for pre-order via the crowdfunding platform – IndieGoGo. In Sri
Lanka, we also retail our products at Trunk, Cinnamon Grand, Barefoot Galle, and Azeiya
Boutique Galle. What is your top fashion tip? Fashion is a mode that not only conveys your
personality but also has the power to make a huge difference in the world we live in.
Invest in products that make you feel as good as you look. Fashion prediction for next
season? Our next collection will be a combination of subtle colours with the introduction
of woven motifs. We are also hoping to use all natural dyes for the entire collection.Overall, we expect top handle bags, shoulder bag styles and clutches to be the popular
choices this AW season. In terms of colour, we expect the handbags to be mostly in darker
shades with a hint of bright colours like red or orange. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

life_fashion90_16_Custom_Creating_Sarees_with_Kalynda.pdf,"Custom Creating Sarees with Kalynda
May 06 2019. Mixing and matching borders, fabrics, embellishments, textures and colours to
create a special genre of the time less and classic saree what saree designer Hiruni
Mendis is attempting with her bespoke saree brand Kalynda. Hiruni custom constructs sarees
to order and her creations carry a distinct look when compared with the more prevalent
saree options in the market featuring ethnic designs, handloom weaves and Batik motifs. It
is a look Hiruni describes as simple, elegant and unique. Many of Kalynda’s clients are
professionals and working women who are drawn not only to her unique designs but also to
the convenience of the service Kalynda offers. In a market dominated by mass produced
sarees, why did you decide to start your venture in custom constructed saris?. Before
starting Kalynda I was employed in the corporate sector in Sri Lanka and I found that I
needed simple, elegant and unique sarees for work related functions. Considering the
number of events a typical working woman has to attend, these sarees needed to be
affordable as well. It was out of this need that I developed my label Kalynda. I wanted to
bring together fabrics, prints, embellishments and combinations that no one would imagine
being put together in to a saree. Once I launched the label I connected with so many
working women who loved my concept of simple, understated and elegant sarees. Today I
create sarees for all types of occasions including special occasion wear but the core idea
is to give the wearer something different when compared with the usual saree options you
get in a store. For someone thinking about getting a custom designed sari done for the
first time, could you run through a typical customer journey and rough timelines they can
expect? The process starts with me sharing a few preliminary questions with my clients
regarding the type of occasion they need the saree for and the design, color and materials
they have in mind. The second matter that gets addressed is the budget. Kalynda Custom
made sarees start from Rs. 13,000 upwards and I generally would like customers to have an
understanding of the rough budget they are working with. We take a minimum of ten working
days to design and create a basic saree. So if these queries are answered and the client
is satisfied with the specified pricing we move ahead to work on more details. Most of
these conversations with clients happen online. We get a lot done over whatsapp and or
facebook chat and quite frankly most clients prefer this. Discussions are clear and
recorded and there is very little room for ambiguity and misunderstandings . Once the
designing process starts I keep every client updated on the details, specifically send
them pictures on what colors I suggest, borders and motifs etc and it is only based on
their approvals that I go ahead with executing the ideas. With most of my clients being
either overseas or working women who are pressed for time, this system works very well.
Clients who wish to visit my workshop in Mount Lavinia, are welcome to do so with a prior
appointment. And finally once the design is done customers can visit my workshop for a fit
on. Adjustments are done immediately so that the client does not waste time doing multiple
fit-ons. The completed saree can either be collected from the workshop or we deliver
anywhere both locally and internationally. What’s in vogue right now with sarees? I can
think of three distinct trends. Floral prints have been around for a while and are still
in trend. Pastel and nude shades such as ice blue and baby pink are highly in vogue now.
Ruffle sarees are trending in India and I have seen a few designers replicate it here too.
It is something quite different and a very rare combination of fabrics need to be used for
this design. We too have started experimenting with this trend and hope to come out with a
few with our own twist to the style. Overall I would like to note that sarees are getting
simpler with more defined work. What’s in vogue right now for sari blouses? The sari
blouse sleeve has become a point to explore with and you can see many designers doing
ruffle sleeves, bell sleeves, the puff sleeves etc. In situations where the focus is given
to the blouse, the saree is obviously given minimum attention. Who is your typicalcustomer? I find it difficult to narrow my typical customer down to any particular age
group. But I would say it has more to do with a particular type of personality. I feel
that younger clients look for simple designs but they are not too worried about
exclusivity. I have noticed that women in their 30s, have a special need for uniqueness
and exclusivity and hence there is a huge demand for custom made sarees. But in both cases
I find that’s it mostly the workingwomen who like to experiment with unique designs but
find it difficult to do with the time constraints they work with. Therefore I have created
Kalynda to cater to their every need. Unique designs, affordable pricing and convenience
in execution and delivery. After launching Kalynda 4 years ago, what have you learnt about
the work you do?. Firstly, I know my customer better now than I did before. When I first
launched I would need to have lengthy conversations with a client to ascertain her exact
requirement. Today I can determine this almost instantly. I’ve also learnt to work with
the peaks and troughs in this line of work. I’m more aware of trends, I know more about
market demands and I have a sense of peak and off-peak seasons in a given year. I am able
to manage my client list better now. During peak seasons I encourage clients to give me
longer delivery timelines and I use the off-peak period to come out with our own
collections that clients can buy off the rack. What are your future plans with Kalynda?
Last year I launched a brand called Taaya Boutique. Taaya offers off the shelf sarees.
With Kalynda we create only one saree of any given design making it very exclusive. With
Taaya I create about ten sarees of each design and these sarees can be purchased off the
rack. I have plans to expand both brands. I am also planning to open up my own design
studio and store which will be open for walk in customers. I receive a lot of interest in
my creations from overseas markets. Therefore I have plans to expand in to these markets
as well. Your comment (*)",6400
life_fashion90_16_Designer_1-2-1_Joanne_Stoker.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Joanne Stoker
Sep 28 2021. Sustainability is a much-vaunted word in the fashion world with almost every
designer promoting their sustainability credentials. Joanne Stoker the Founder of Nåd
launched in 2020 uses deadstock to create her collections. Deadstock fabrics are the
leftover fabrics of other fashion houses that overestimated their needs. Traditionally,
brands would hold on to their excess fabrics for a few seasons and then send them to the
landfills. Pamunuwa and Pettah are places where some of the deadstock end up if they
escape the journey to landfill sites. As Joanne uses deadstock, she rarely finds large
quantities of any one fabric and colour. Small rolls mean small production runs. This
ensures production is limited to only 1 or 2 dresses in a specific fabric or print. A
perfect solution for the brand as they rescue beautiful fabrics and create one of a kind
dresses. How has your work evolved since you began your own label? Trying to be as
sustainable as possible has an impact on your designs and how you create your styles. This
really is reflecting more and more in some of my designs. Are there any types of clothing
that you avoid designing? I’m not into polyester or synthetic fabric, as I want my clothes
to be breathable, light and airy. This rules out the more fitted, body-con styles. I tend
to focus on more oversized and voluminous silhouettes. Where do you look for creative
inspiration? At the moment I am focusing on materials, I’m trying to create more woven
fabrics with local artisans. I would love to start working more with Beralu lace and I
suppose finding unique and unusual fabrics when hunting through warehouse factory dead
stock has an influence on how I create the next collection. Describe your latest
collection? The latest collection is for The Design Collective Sustainable Edit. It
comprises my favourite style, the 4 colour-block Iris Dress, which is zero waste. Each
dress is unique and comes in one of a kind colour-way, handmade from the last remaining
fabric, I have from the mainline collection. Who is your muse? I don’t have a muse, but I
love street style! There are some super cool bloggers who experiment a lot with colour
combinations, Leonie Hanne from Germany is a particular favourite. What are your
sustainability credentials? I like to focus on dead-stock fabrics, organic materials and I
am in the process of weaving some plant dyed fabrics with Amma, in Nuwara Eliya. What are
you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? Living in Sri Lanka
and not leaving for 2 years due to Covid, the main fascination and influence is nature. I
have also been watching a lot of documentaries on Netflix. The David Attenborough, ‘A Life
On Our Planet’ is amazing. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you
started your company? Be patient, we are going through a pandemic. What’s your motto?
Every little step counts, keep going forward organically and slowly. Which international
or local designers are you inspired by? Watching the recent fashion shows there is so much
changing globally with designers! It’s not so much about fashion but making social and
political statements. The Balenciaga SS 2022 show was very cool. Along with the use of
plus-size, transgender and models with disabilities, the catwalk and how clothes are
presented is changing rapidly. I also love the influence of space travel, which can be
seen in so many shows this season. The local designers I feel are really looking more at
craft and sustainability, which is great for the Sri Lanka fashion industry, as it creates
a different kind of style, which sets us apart from the rest of the world. Both the Design
Collective and PR have a great selection of local designers with unique styles. What role
do you think social media plays in fashion today? It’s definitely an important part of
life for Gen Z and great to get your brand out there and find interesting and unique
inspirations and reads, however, I still prefer a magazine! Great fashion editorials and a
good article is much more enjoyable than quickly flicking through posts! What is your
favourite part about being a designer? Creating new styles and seeing the collection come
to life! Plus wearing your own clothing is always great, although there has not been ahuge amount of opportunity this year. How do you want women to feel when wearing your
clothes? Cool, light and free! Model - Zainu Hussian Photographer - Mustaq Thasleem HMU -

life_fashion90_16_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_Day_2.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week Day 2
Mar 24 2018. Day 2 of the HSBC Colombo Fashion Week 2018 for Spring/Summer ’19 took place
on the 23rd of March at Hilton Colombo. Structured silhouettes, bold designs and an
eclectic assortment of colours hit the runway as 8 designers, both local and
international, presented their collections. Speaking to Founder and President Ajai Vir
Singh about Day 2 he tells us that it went ‘amazing’. “The shows are looking slicker. It’s
becoming easier in the 15th year and I hope the momentum continues. The designers look
good and the Sri Lankan designers are looking strong and overall, it’s just a great
celebration” “Day 2 was an exciting step up from yesterday, the atmosphere at fashion week
is so highly energetic and encouraging and so receptive to new talent. Sri Lankan fashion
has a great future!” adds CEO Fazeena Rajabdeen. Eymeric Francois The Parisian fashion
graced the ramp at CFW when Eymeric Francois showcased his collection. Fitting silhouettes
which accentuated the feminine form were the mainstay of his collection. His choice of
fabrics and lace detailing added a luxury element to the designs. Edgy yet sensual,
Francois’s collection was an exciting start to the show. LICC Jeans LICC brings back the
jean mania as they showed the audience why and how denim still remains the people’s
favourite. Jeans, shorts, jackets and dresses all made an appearance and showcased not
just its versatility but just how fashionable jeans can really be! The Old Railway By
Catherine Rawson British designer based in Galle, The Old Railway is a brand that is a
regular at CFW. Inspired by the music on pirate radio stations played across Hackney
during her time in London, The Old Railway presented an eclectic collection that was hip
and urban. Layers on layers in mixed fabrics of vivid colours strutted down the runway.
Stripes, sequins and bold use of prints gave the ensemble its signature look. Urvashi Kaur
Founder and designer behind the namesake label, Urvashi Kaur endorses an alternate fashion
movement by embracing hand-woven, organic textiles and natural dyes. A colour palette of
nude tones, black and slate in structured linen silhouettes with subtle prints dominated
the collection. Controlled pleats and light layers were seen in several designs. Her
collection offered a blend of traditional and contemporary wear, giving the audience a
peek into the multi-cultural world. Maus By Annika Fernando Launched in 2013, MAUS focuses
on wardrobe quality essentials made ethically with clean-cut designs. MAUS includes MAUS
Organic and MAUS Swim which are all proudly made in Sri Lanka. This year’s collection saw
the launch of MAUS Man with an array of dresses and jumpsuits for ladies and comfortable
fabrics for a gentleman. Mono colour pastel shades in cotton and linen textile sashayed
down the ramp and the all leather footwear by MAUS completed the MAUS look. “It’s an
honour to take part in CFW’s 15th anniversary show. And it’s always a highlight in our
calendar. The collection was inspired by everything; life in Sri Lanka and the tropics so
it’s an interesting range of colours this time!” Indi By Indeevari Yapa Abeyawardena The
creative force behind House of Indi with brands like INDI, IYA Bride, iBRIDE and INDI
DIVA, Indi’s collection was inspired by the ‘Bohemian World.’ Using imported handwoven
fabrics from Bohemia, Moroccan laces, local traditional crafted embellishments and
embroidery, the designs were vibrant and well detailed. The collection began with
silhouettes inspired by the Bohemian mosaics, architecture and décor and progressed into
silhouettes featuring intricate details from Royal Gypsy of Bohemia. Dramatic sleeves,
plunge necklines and gold detailing were a few standout details in the collection. LOVI
Ceylon by Asanka De Mel Taking the Sri Lankan sarong to the world, LOVI’s collection
‘Unity’ imagines a fresh identity for Sri Lankan style. Paying homage to the rich clothing
history of Sri Lanka, the collection saw royal crown monograms, Nilame outfits, refined
handlooms and tri-colour unity band prints in each design. Inspired by the historic kings
of Sri Lanka, the British colonization, Independence, war and peace, LOVI presented a
collection that is elegant, modern and functional and one that embodies the brand’stagline ‘Loved in LOVI’. Sonali Dharmawardene Both an artist and a designer, Sonali’s use
of batik in her line of couture is what makes her a master of her craft. Having showcased
her collections internationally in the UK, US, Malaysia, India and France among others,
Sonali has been a part of CFW since 2011. Sonali’s collection was all about women of
diverse economic backgrounds, colours, faiths and states. The 35 piece collection saw a
visually stunning diverse range of designs alternating between dresses, skirts, pants,
tops and sarees in intricate batik designs. Refined, elegant and sophisticated, Sonali
provided a fitting finale to Day 2 of CFW. “If it was well received that’s the best part
of it. I used all types of natural fabrics from cottons to linens to silk” See all pics

life_fashion90_16_Inaugural_Launch_Of_The_Ceylon_Heritage_Festival_Fashion_Sho.pdf,"Inaugural Launch Of The Ceylon Heritage Festival Fashion Show
Sep 11 2023. The annual Ceylon Heritage Festival by the Rachel Raj Foundation and the
Ministry of Industries will have its inaugural launch with a fashion show dedicated to
artisanal traditional textile crafts on September 27 at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.
The event will serve as the launch pad for the new “Heritage Hands” label, a 100% Sri
Lankan-crafted clothing and accessory brand endorsed by the Industrial Development Board.
For years, Sri Lanka’s textile cottage industries have been one of the island’s best-kept
secrets. From our dumbara weavers in the hill country to our beeralu lace makers down
south and our palymrah fibre textiles from the north, nowhere in the world boasts the
unique craftsmanship and quality of these centuries-old artisanal textiles. The art of the
craft is privy to only a select few in rural Sri Lanka and has been passed down from
generation to generation in order to keep this art form alive. Unfortunately, being the
island's best-kept secret is slowly killing this indigenous craft as artisans struggle to
compete with the cheaper, lower-quality alternatives with little to no access or support
to enter new markets. Where countries like Mexico and Africa, which create unique
textiles, market their cultural crafts to the world, our traditional textiles fly under
the radar with limited global exposure. Coupled with soaring costs of living and finding
little opportunity in the industry, this generational heritage craft is on the decline and
very much at risk of disappearing altogether. Sarita Rajandran, Founder and Managing
Director of the Rachel Raj resort and swimwear brand which employs and works closely with
several artisans of the crafts for the luxury fashion label, is well aware of the
struggles these artistes face and believes that these traditional textile industries are
severely underutilised and undervalued. ""One of the reasons the cottage industries are
declining is that these crafts haven't been curated to cater to the modern palate. The
global market is crazy for traditional craftsmanship in fashion, but it needs to be modern
and wearable, and because we haven't developed our craft to blend in with the times, our
artisans are missing out on a huge market opportunity."" In celebration of her label's 10th
anniversary this year, Sarita founded the Rachel Raj Foundation to empower and promote
traditional textile crafts in international markets. Together with the Ministry of
Industries, under the guidance of the Minister, Hon. (Dr.) Ramesh Pathirana and the
Industrial Development Board, the Ceylon Heritage Festival was conceptualised to showcase
Sri Lanka's heritage industries of fashion, art, music, literature, and more. While the
Festival is set to be an annual encounter, the inaugural event will be marked by a Fashion
Show this year, in a conscious effort to preserve the country's resources given the
current economic crunch. The Ceylon Heritage Festival Fashion Show will showcase the role
of Sri Lanka's indigenous textile crafts in modern design palettes with the launch of the
Heritage Hands label. The label will incorporate pieces where traditional crafts, such as
dumbara weaving, beeralu lace, bamboo and palmyra fibre fabric, crochet, handloom and
batik printing will be the mainstay of the collection. While these textile crafts are
often visualised in a traditional setting, the Heritage Hands collection juxtaposes the
old with the new, showcasing how effortlessly tradition and trend can combine to bridge
the gap between heritage and contemporary fashion. The show will also feature pieces
designed by the graduates of Moratuwa University's Fashion Textile Engineering department.
Following the launch of the brand, the Heritage Hands collection will be made available
exclusively at Laksala stores islandwide. Speaking on the IDB’s endorsement and support
given to the Festival and the Heritage Hands label, the Chairman of the IDB, Dr. Saranga
Alahapperuma shared that the Board together with the Ministry are looking positively at
this show as it is the first-ever fashion show dedicated solely to the cottage industries.
“Over 20,000 skilled artisans work in this industry, but sadly, because they aren't
utilising modern marketing techniques to expand into new markets and because theyfrequently target low-end local markets, there is little industry growth and very little
interaction from the younger generations because they don't see much future potential in
their craft right now. Because of this, we want to take it on and support these artisans
by making it easier for them to access new, international markets.” “The traditional
textile crafts produce very unique designs and high-quality, sustainable material. With
the fashion show and the label, I think buyers can see the versatility of this market and
we hope to take the craft offshore and give these artisans the support they need to pitch
to foreign buyers and international shows.” The Ceylon Heritage Festival Fashion Show will
be presented to foreign buyers and the diplomatic strata as well as the public in hopes of
attracting international buyers and fostering collaborations that can further boost the
export of these industries and pave the way to enter new markets. The Festival not only
aims to contribute to the growth of Sri Lanka's economy and bring exposure to
international markets but also, and perhaps more importantly, help preserve and pass down
the art of traditional textile crafting to future generations. Tickets are priced Rs. 5000
and are inclusive of the fashion show and cocktail beverages. Tickets will be available at
Ramani Fernando Salons - Elibank Road (Tuesday-Saturday 9.30 – 5pm) and Borella ( 9.30 –
5pm Daily) and Playtrix Sports Bar Colombo City Centre (11-6pm Daily). (Pix Courtesy: RRF)

Sep 26 2018. Beauty isn’t only about looks and this was proven at the Facia Miss Universe
Sri Lanka pageant which concluded last evening at the Hilton. As another attempt to
celebrate the beauty of Sri Lankan women, Model Shop in association with Voice of Asia
Networks made history as they produced two title holders a few hours apart. The 11
contestants who made it to the finals were from different backgrounds and each one of them
had a unique story of their own. The evening began with the Channa-Upuli Dancers bringing
in a cultural treat for all guests as they performed an act from a procession. Each
contestant was beautifully clad with some mind-blowing attire designed by Lou Ching Wong
himself. As the producer and the choreographer of the show, Wong had taken all efforts to
maintain a high quality in terms of the production. During the finale, an expert panel of
judges including renowned actress Veena Jayakody, creative director at Hilton Colombo Kay
Ng, hair stylist and the first Sri Lankan male to climb Mt. Everest Johann Peiris and the
ever-so-popular dancing sensation Upuli Panibharatha took their seats to adjudge the
winners of the evening. Amidst all the excitement, the winners of the mini pageants were
sashed as follows : Denta Most Beautiful Smile : Amandi Soysa Aliya Resorts and Spa Dances
of Sri Lanka: Marion Wettasinghe Real Radio Miss Popular: Ornella Gunasekara Offmarks Face
of the Year: Natalee Fernando Singer Miss Talent: Marion Wettasinghe Fadna Miss
BodyBeautiful: Marion Wettasinghe LICC Model of the year: Ornella Gunasekara Triumph Miss
Confidence: Ornella Gunasekara Facia Most Beautiful hair: Wasana Gunasekara Facia
MissCongeniality: Ornella Gunasekara The contestants were clad in evening wear also
designed by Lou Ching himself and eventually, the top five contestants were announced. It
was quite interesting to note how all five of them faced the judges with absolute
confidence. These are the results of the team of experts who worked tirelessly to groom
them to be who they were at the grand finale. As the evening drew to an end, Natalee
Fernando and Marion Wettasinghe were sashed as the second and the first runner up
respectively, while Ornella Gunasekara was crowned as Facia Miss Universe Sri Lanka 2018
and will represent Sri Lanka at the main pageant in Thailand. We also didn’t forget to
speak to a few faces behind the success of the show, the judges and a few guests: Couture
designer and choreographer of the show Lou Ching Wong said that a lot of hard work went
into the show. “But I’m fighting to do better every time. The girls performed very well
and I was able to execute my idea well. They extended their fullest supported although I’m
very strict when I get to business.” Model Shop directors “It was an amazing journey and
I’m so happy with the outcome. But for me all the girls are winners because they
transformed themselves into individuals with a lot of self-confidence. I got good feedback
from the audience in terms of the show and the judges’ choice.” – Sangeetha Weeraratne “It
has been six months since we started this journey with Model Shop and today was one of
those much awaited days. We made history as we organised two grand pageants in one day.
Although we had many obstacles to overcome we managed to succeed. During the next couple
of years we aim to produce an international winner from our country.” – Dhananjaya Bandara
“With Model Shop we try to give an opportunity for our girls to expose their talents and
build up their confidence. As such it has been an amazing journey thus far and we hope to
identify hidden talents from Sri Lanka and show the world what we can do.” – Shereen
Kumaranatunga “I first tried out this pageant when I was 18. I’m 26 now and I’m so
honoured and thrilled to have worked hard and persevered and finally I got the opportunity
to represent Sri Lanka. I will work hard during the next two to three months to bring the
Miss Universe crown to Sri Lanka.” – Ornella Gunasekara, Winner – Facia Miss Universe Sri
Lanka 2018 “I’m very happy to be the first runner up of this pageant. Even if I didn’t win
a place I’m a winner for my entire life because it was a great learning experience for me.
I can say that I’m not the same person who joined this pageant a couple of months ago. I’mvery happy to have had this opportunity and it was an amazing adventure with a beautiful
bunch of ladies.” – Marion Wettasinghe, First Runner Up “I will continue the work that I
have started. I’m so grateful for this opportunity and I’m glad that I was able to compete
alongside some strong women.” – Natalee Fernando, Second Runner Up “We had to consider
many other criterias , not just beauty. So it was quite a challenging experience being a
judge. Initially, they weren’t very confident but with the training, they came out of
their selves and faced the pageant well.” – Veena Jayakody “The standard of the
competition has improved. Even the girls faced it with much confidence. Their
personalities were quite impressive and it wasn’t an easy selection.” – Johann Peiris “It
was a great honour to be one of the judges for Miss Universe Sri Lanka 2018. This year was
very tough because they were very intelligent apart from the fact that they were all
beautiful. We need to choose the right person to compete with contestants from around the
world because the competition outside Sri Lanka is huge.” – Kay Ng “After a very long time
the Miss Sri Lanka pageant has regained its quality in terms of entertainment, production
and the quality of models. I think both pageants had a bunch of girls who could represent
Sri Lanka internationally. I would like to wish Dhananjaya, Sangeetha and Shereen all the
best for many more successful pageants in future.” – Nelum “It was a good pageant. I have
worked with Lou Ching from back then and I know his ability to bring the best in a
person.” – Nilu “The girls faced it well and the girl that deserves the title won. Ornella
is someone who knows what she’s doing.” – Brian “I would like to wish Ornella all the best
and as a friend I’m happy to see her carrying the title and hope she will do well at the
international pageant as well.” – Jake “I’m proud to see that so many youngsters from
around the world have come to participate in this pageant. I hope they will move forward
and make Sri Lanka proud in different other platforms.” – Amritaa “Sangeetha and the team
worked very hard to achieve this success. It is not an easy task to come up with a show of
this calibre. But in the end, they succeeded and I wish them all the best.” - Sandy Pics

Apr 06 2021. Today I was tagged on my Instagram @danuinnasithamby about an exciting bridal
shoot that made waves in the ever so growing industry. The Bridal industry has grown so
much in our small island home and still continues to do so, but some have made it beyond
the clutter which is refreshing and one person on the list is the Indi Yapa Abeywardena
bride. Since 2015 the brides have made it a point to make a booking at least a year in
advance so that Indi can work her magic. Speaking to me Indi says “compared to 10 years
ago the industry has become very large. Not just from the design-end but in so many
subcategories that got attached & it's booming. Also, it has become a very lucrative
business but on the downside, it’s flooded with people who think you can be a bridal
designer or a planner etc overnight. Lack of talent, lack of commitment also this has
diluted the industry by offering services for cheaper with low-quality products. When the
industry took a big hit with Covid these amazing pictures started making waves and wanted
to ask Indi what this shoot was all about “oh this shoot was something that I was super
excited about as it’s a capsule collection which is a part of the main collection that’s
coming soon this year for Brides of INDI, we started it off as a collab with an amazing
team. I would say with the best in the industry. The team goes as Viran J Peter for makeup
Shane Perera - hair bae for hair. We had the amazingly talented duo Anu & Adrian from
Amarante for photography. So it was great to see everyone’s point of view & the
collaboration of different creative minds coming together. Models are from Agency Sri
Lanka. The collection was mainly focused on an international market for our overseas
brides with destination weddings in mind. We focused on clean sleek sophisticated looks,
with Details we introduced different veil types, volume, separates & “less is more” as the
concept & the feel we wanted to promote here. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a Marketing
qualification (only because he needed to study, and not because he wanted it). He has been
a part of the team for seven years and is the face behind Buzz with Danu, and WTF. Your

Jul 03 2017. Every month I have the fabulous task of compiling a best dressed list, I
attend some fabulous events, sort through hundreds of photos from the past month to find
the best of the best. I do a roundup of events that played host to some of the most
sartorially savvy, polished, eclectic, and stylish of dressers. June saw some incredible
events like Cinnamon Life, Colombo's premier lifetyle developer, hosted 3 days of dinners,
lunches and high tea with beloved Masterchef judge George Calombaris. Another fabulous
event was 'Work In Progress', an introduction to an unfinished new space and a developing
new idea featuring photography, paintings, living sculptures and mixed media work curated
by Dima Sham, Jonathan Wijayaratne and Ryan Wijayaratne. The people on my June list
impressed with their style, their poise, their ability to pull a unique look together and
were the most soigne of the soigne for the month. These style mavens know how to turn
heads. There was no shortage of fashion hits from this most fashionable month and I look
forward to seeing how our city's sartorially savvy bring more stylish looks in July. Fine
Furniture Launch Chervonne (above left) Chervonne knows, as most fashionable women (and
jewellery designers) do, that accessories always elevate a look. The focal point of her
outfit is her jewellery, her wooden necklace (one of her own Cher by Chevonne designs)
pairs so beautifully with the simplicity of the rest of her outfit. This is a difficult
colour to pull off but Krishni does it beautifully. The simplicity of her styling allows
the colour and the draping on her stunning dress to really shine while maintaining her
signature elegance. Launch of Fuze This incredibly cool designer, hardly ever pouts a
sartorial foot wrong. She never plays it safe and always manages to giver her looks a
little edge, this one through her choker. The voluminous proportions of her dress are also
balanced by that piece of jewellery. Kudos! It's playful, flattering, insanely cool and
has just the right amount of visual interest. Her kimono-esque, belted top is very McQueen
and her subtle pink shorts and Dior bag really allow it to centre stage as does her
pairing in with bang on trend white trainers. She's definitely one to watch in the style
stakes! What a fabulous outfit and she wears it beautifully. She understands how to
perfectly balance an outfit by pairing her multi-hued floral jacket with navy pants and
black accessories. The vibrant hues work fabulously with her complexion and her look is
both fun and sophisticated. Cinnamon Life presents George Calombaris Yes to everything
going on here. It's not often that a dress can be sweet and sophisticated at once. I love
how Roshni opted for a style with an interesting hemline that works fabulously with her
crossbody Chanel. Between her striking beauty, monochrome, nipped in waist look, gorgeous
Louis Vuitton bag and uuber cool stilettos, this look is a total home run. Work in
Progress at The Design Collective, Gandhara Elegant, cool and bang on trend with the cold
shoulder top. Jaish really does make the case for black and beige pairings. I love that
her gold strappy sandals allow that funky blue nail polish to really shine! What I like
about Ryan is that he never seems to try too hard. After all, being stylish is like being
funny: it doesn't work if you force it. He's innately cool and it shows. Shahili (above
centre) Insanely cool to wear, dungarees are great as you don't need to worry about
matching your top to your bottom. This look works because it's a statement all on its own
(no cool accessories required). This outfit has a great mix of masculine and feminine
elements and her YSL clutch works well with it too. Your comment (*)",3791

De Lanerolle Brothers In Concert Sometimes it's important not to overcomplicate things.
This outfit is so successful because its colour is perfect on her, and there are no
embellishments or unnecessary accessories to detract from the vibrant hue. Paired with
monochrome t-bar pumps, it's a great look. Polka dots heavily championed by Dolce &
Gabanna, Balenciaga and Loewe to name a few designers who showed them for SS17, are
flirty, retro, whimsical and never seem to go out of style! This dress is simple in its
structure and works well paired with flats for a more casual, fun aesthetic. Ramani
Fernando Elegant as always, Ramani delivers a masterclass on how to wear red. Breaking the
head to T- bar toe red with black accessories, her outfit is reminiscent of Kristen Scott
Thomas' Valentino look for Cannes. Michael Learns To Rock Live In Sri Lanka The spot on
colour pairing (one loved by Miu Miu, they created a perfume bottle in these exact colours
- L'Eau Bleue), the overlay and the practical (for a concert) strappy sandals don't look
overdone because they are so strategic and it helps that she carries the off-beat cool
look with confidence.0 Launch of Weber Grills A keen advocate for style and someone who's
passionate about fashion, talking about it with intelligence and enthusiasm, Shalin never
disappoints in the style stakes. This is how you do cocktail casual. The fluted bell

Jun 23 2025. By Gayantha Perera Recently, I was at an event, and a rather fierce
personality and iconic individual was wearing a tulle skirt and a blazer as their outfit.
It was an amazing ensemble; from the colours to the way the accessories were paired, it
was simply stunning. I couldn’t help but think out loud, “Why didn’t I think of this?”.
And all this person had to smile and say was “You should just do it!”. I laughed and
thought… Yeah, I can, but why don’t I? It's 2025, and the line between what men would wear
and what women would wear has blurred so much that separate sections in stores are almost
obsolete. In a 2022 survey, 36% of U.S. consumers had purchased fashion outside their
gender identity, followed by Sweden (33%) and the UK (31%). In a world where regular or
loose fit is currently king, girls who like men's athleisure or tailoring are killing it
in the style department. Men are also finding interesting uses for ladies' compression
wear and ladies’ tops that make for extremely fashion-forward inner layers or top layers,
even the ever-so-trendy cropped jackets are not safe. The mid-2020s will forever be
gender-neutral fashion day for me, and Gen-Z is leading the charge. A study by Fashion Law
Journal quotes that around 50% of Gen-Z online shoppers globally have purchased gender-
fluid fashion, and 70% say they are interested in purchasing more in the future. But
coming to our shores, the pearl of the Indian Ocean, it seems that pearls are still
expected only on women’s ears. My personal forays into gender-bending fashion have been
quite limited. A pair of denim from a ladies’ section here and there, a blouse that looked
like a perfect shirt or top with a suit maybe, and on a rare occasion, a dress for a
runway show. However fashion-forward ‘Colombo people’ might be, I’ve never felt
comfortable bending the rules for an outfit for myself outside of those moments. I feel
confident in saying that it's really not my aesthetic. But part of me also wonders if it's
just my conservative Christian upbringing whitewashing my mind, trying to colour outside
the lines. Sri Lanka has always had rigid views on genders and the way they dress, and
much of the LGBTQI+ community will admit that dressing for one’s personal choice might not
be the safest bet all the time, even in the city of Colombo. But in 2025, why is that the
norm? I once had the pleasure of advising a client who couldn’t get himself to buy a pink
tie at a leading men's fashion store because people might make fun of him. I recently had
trouble convincing a female celebrity about the trend of masculine tailoring for an outfit
because she was unsure about how her male fans would respond to her feminine curves being
hidden. And even more recently, a Facebook post that featured ladies’ innerwear by a
garment producer in the country on a visibly male model went viral and exposed how even in
Colombo, it was still not safe to be inclusive, even in theory. So the short of it is,
it's prejudice; internal and external. The solution is clearly work that needs to begin
within our industry to educate everyone that it is a clear fact that clothing & fashion
are quite genderless. From dressing mannequins with gender swaps to advertising gender-
swapped outfits for the models featured. Even when public figures embrace the freedom to
dress devoid of gender, it normalises it for everyone. But most of all, training for
retail sales staff to welcome all shoppers without judgment or assumptions would be key; a
memorable exchange with staff of a leading retail store in Colombo comes to mind, where a
sales girl couldn’t believe I was shopping for pants in the ladies section and went to
great lengths to explain it to me, assuming I didn’t understand her heavy accent. My
personal belief is, if you like it and you find it in a size that fits you, buy it and
wear it, and I hope you have the confidence to wear it wherever you want to. But that’s
just me. I think the whole country needs vocal proponents in every sphere that allow any
gender to wear what they want. Here are a few worth mentioning from the men's fashion
industry. Shan De Silva, to me, is a modern advocate of the cause I mention here. “The
real sign of evolution in Lankan masculinity and fashion is the realisation, recognitionand celebration of the fact that masculinity and femininity go hand in hand. Regardless of
gender.” They embody the fluidity of Fashion and look great in anything as a leading model
from the fashion industry. Pictured: Shan De Silva “The beauty is that each generation
defines its own gender norms. I’m proud to see a more peaceful, confident, ambitious, and
open-minded Sri Lankan masculinity emerging among Millennials and Gen Z. Young men are
embracing LOVI’s Sri Lankan style far more than older generations. So we can all hope for
a better future!” says Asanka De Mel, founder of LOVI Sarongs. Pictured: Asanka De Mel ""I
don’t dress to fit into boxes of ‘masculine’ or ‘feminine’—I dress to express,” says
Designer Vinol Ruwanweliarachchi. “My style blends tradition with modern elegance, where
every piece tells a story beyond convention."" Pictured: Vinol Ruwanweliarachchi But as all
opinions are valid, Amandha Amarasekara, a leading men's fashion content creator, shared,
“I believe that while fashion is inherently genderless, the distinction between men’s and
women’s fashion is what gives each its unique identity and deserved recognition. In Sri
Lanka, though Western influences are softening rigid norms, I remain a strong advocate for
preserving masculinity in men’s fashion with a clear, intentional boundary.”

Nov 14 2017. Celebrating their 26th industry in the handloom industry, Selyn launched
'Sthri' a collective of empowered fashion. Speaking at the launch, Selyna Wanduragala, who
is on taking the vision of her mother Sandra, the founder of Selyn forward said, ""Sthri is
an ethical fashion collective created to empower a network of women and rural communities
in Sri Lanka. Sthri represents the woman of Sri Lanka and this collection is in essence
empowered fashion which seeks to empower those who wear it and make it in the same manner.
In commemoration of 26 years in operation, this new collective uses the strong fair trade
foundation of the company to create a platform to gather empowered designers, social
brands, women and men to further to causes Selyn stands for."" The gala fashion show which
was held at Park Street Mews, saw a range of real women in all shapes and sizes walk the
runway wearing this collection which was a collaboration with Arosha Rosenberger, an
ethical fashion designer of Sri Lankan origin. Arosha runs the Tuschimo fashion label in
Germany along with social brands such as Emerge and Salvage. Gorgeous handloom sarees in
varied hues along with western attire ranging from jumpsuits and shorts to skirts and
dresses with asymmetrical hemlines were sent down the runway. The beauty of the collection
was that these clothes would suit women of all shapes and sizes and will flatter the
feminine form. A great maiden show, kudos to the team at Selyn for pulling off a great
runway show which at the very heart of it was all about empowering women. We spoke to a
few people at the show. Jude “Collaborations are good, this collection followed a Japanese
aesthetic and the clothes looked fab” ""The clothes are bright and colourful and they are
just perfect for island life” Darshi Keerthisena ""Selyn has always been a great
inspiration, the only Fair Trade certified brand, they resonate well with my work ethic
too"" The collection had a practical element which was good. Also you could see yourself
wearing those clothes” Selyna “It was an inspiring and challenging journey to put on this
show. It is a realisation that fashion and lifestyle can be the face of a social movement.

life_fashion90_17_Designer_1-2-1_Catherine_Rawson.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Catherine Rawson
Nov 12 2018. British designer Catherine Rawson is the proprietor of The Old Railway, a
much sought after fashion store in Galle. A regular at Colombo Fashion Week, Catherine’s
creations are quirky with functional vibe. Catherine uses remnants of fabric left over
from the garment industry in Sri Lanka which ensures that the pieces she creates are
limited and not mass produced. Her latest offering is a capsule collection of mix and
match separates which she has created for her online store. What inspired this collection?
I was getting lots of messages via Fb / Instagram/ email from previous customers wanting
to purchase more of the same thing in different colours and prints. I decided to create a
capsule mix and match collection of our most popular pieces to sell online. How many
pieces have you created for this collection? There are only 6 pieces. I decided it would
be better to start it small and have the stock. then expand later. The pieces are palazzo
trousers, culottes, a shirt, halter neck top, a dress and a kimono. Where do you source
your fabrics and materials from? Mostly I source within Galle unless I need a very
specific colour for bespoke items and where possible I use remnants of fabric left over
from the massive garment industry in Sri Lanka. For the online collection all fabrics are
sourced in Galle. How many collections do you create per season/year? In the shop we
constantly make new pieces every day! It’s not seasonal. For the online collection I will
add new fabrics and prints every six months and I'm hoping to add a new design each year.
Like I said I'd like it to stay small until its well established. We also create a
collection specifically for Colombo Fashion Week once a year. What differentiates your
clothes from other designers? I think the complete process of production being done in
house, in our studio creates unique pieces of high quality. We also do very small runs of
things and a lot of our pieces are one offs. We are not fashion/trend led at all. It's
about styling women along with their existing wardrobe and making our pieces fit into
that. How ethically savvy do you think Sri Lankan fashion consumers are? Probably more so
than in the Western World as many people here have relatives working in the huge factories
making items for export. They see the frustration of using beautiful fabrics and skilled
finishing machinery but not being able to access the products made in this process within
their own market, everything is 'signed out'. Having said that we all like a bargain and
limited finances force most people to search for the cheapest available option which is
unlikely to be ethically sourced. What are the key themes you have concentrated on for
this collection? Comfort, classic shapes, easy to style and mix and match i not existing
wardrobes. If you are ordering online from the other side of the world I think very
complicated items with lots of layers and hidden fastenings are too risky for people to
take the plunge. Talk us through your creative process I always start with the fabric.
From that I imagine a shape and flow that will work and then Chitra (my head tailor and
pattern maker) and I work together to draft the pattern. We make a sample and try it on a
few different people to see how it hangs and suits different body types. Once we are happy
we grade the patterns and add any details. Everything is individually handout, sewn and
hand embroidered/embellished in our studio and I can oversee the whole process. That is
part of the attraction of our place, people can the clothes being made in front of them as
they shop, there is no other authentic shopping experience for clothing like it in Galle,
and possibly in Sri Lanka. How does Galle bode for a designer like yourself? I love living
in Galle. We have a good mix of tourists and expats through the door. I can find lovely
fabrics and Colombo is only a short bus ride away if I need specific trimmings or
specialist fabric. We also sell in TRUNK in The Cinnamon Grand Hotel in Colombo and the
new online venture spreads us out further afield. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_17_Designer_1-2-1__Malisha_Nicoli.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Malisha Nicoli
Sep 18 2017. Malisha Nicoli is the designer behind the menswear fashion brand Alter Ego.
Malisha was encouraged to embark on a career in fashion by her father who was always
immaculately turned out. She recently launched her latest collection Bravolution 17 which
she hopes will revolt against the common concept of menswear in Sri Lanka. Currently the
brand has an online retail presence but there are plans of expansion into retail stores
within the next few months. What made you embark on a career in fashion? My dad for sure.
Growing up he’s always pushed me into channeling my creative side as he himself was in a
creative field.He was a well-dressed man who had a funny obsession on perfumes and
smelling good. I’d say he was my biggest believer and my mother who is still an amazing
motivator. What is your latest collection called? “Bravolution’17” Describe this new
collection? I wanted the first collection to give a sense of fashion and also comfort
catering to all types of personalities. Every piece in this line will give you very
carefully designed fits, for example I have “Slim fit” which gives a much tailored look on
the wearer and “Easy fit” which will give your upper body a fitted look and from below the
chest level would give you a much relaxed look. How long have you been a designer for?
Close to 4 years now. What inspired this collection? The collection name was inspired by
how my pieces and the brand overall will “revolt” against the common concept of menswear
in Sri Lanka. This has been the main reason as to why the detailing of the shirts have
international aspects and is fashion forward. What are the challenging aspects of running
a fashion business in Sri Lanka? The fashion industry in Sri Lanka is surely evolving
rapidly over the years. It’s quite a lot of extremely talented designers in our little
island, who are all strong and career driven. The challenging part for me would definitely
be identified as a “Designer Wear Business”among everyone emerging with all types of
clothing businesses Where do you retail your stuff? I am focusing as an online selling
brand at the moment, hopefully will branch out to Fashion boutiques within the year. What
is your top fashion tip? Plain oxford shirt with the perfect fit. Dress it down dress it
up, it works either way! Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? Not that big of a
shopaholic. But I would say “Thirteen Thirty One”. All the pieces I have from them are
very trendy and fits well. Fashion prediction for next season? Definite pop of colors!
Cool shades of blues, easy Chinese collar shirts and delicate cotton fabrics. Why did you
decide to do menswear? I experimented a lot throughout the years of being a designer and
finally menswear spoke to me like no other category in fashion. I loved the fact that it’s
a niche market and I could be breaking boundaries when it comes to men’s fashion. What is
that you like about designing menswear? I would say the details. It seems like a very
simple task to cover menswear but when taking all the fine detailing and the fit of a
garment it has to be mastered or your design fall behind as every other shirt. It’s a
gamble. What were you doing before you became a designer? Always been a designer working
my way forward since I graduated with a Degree in Fashion Design from Raffles Design. What
are the challenging aspects of designing menswear? Everything after creating my sketches!
It’s a very niche market for menswear brands which means fabric sourcing, production and
reaching out to the customers is a huge challenge. Getting that right quality and
producing something that’s durable sometimes can be challenging as I try to improve with
every chance I get. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel,

life_fashion90_17_Fashionably_Danu-_Featuring_Manic_Phase.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu- Featuring Manic Phase
Jan 31 2018. Looking dapper in this weather can take a lot out of us. Especially when we
have a lot of sun ! We always look for a comfy fit and t-shirts are the top choice for
this, but when it makes you look so underdressed it is disappointing. But we finally found
some classy look t-shirts! Keeping it classy is what this brand I feature is all about.
Dive in and explore their selection of men's T-shirts. From boxy skater-style tees to eye-
catching pattern mix, today's designer has got them all, even his personal style is simply
fascinating I spoke to Farzan Sheriff from Manic Phase to know more about him and his
brand. What sparked your interest in fashion? I basically just like anything beautiful or
well designed. Fashion always had an appeal for me, from flipping through magazines to
sketching my own designs. It's also deeper than that. It always felt good to know what I
was wearing looked good and someone told me so, it gave me confidence. Confidence is key.I
eventually began to research designers and photographers, started following Brands, became
inspired by the beautiful ads and shows. Fashion is beauty - it’s art and impacts society
in a way that no other cultural element does, for better or for worse. I really hate it
when people say fashion is unimportant, I mean it's what we wear on our backs, isn't it,
so it does affect each and every one of us. I just find that so intriguing. Tell me about
your collection which you have featured in this shoot? My collection is T DROP I want to
project a difference in what I do and think out of the box. My designs are not standard or
ordinary even pattern wise. I don’t want to look normal, normal is boring. My tees are
long and I have a concept called body and neck culture. I play with the neck and body
designs, and patterns on my tees. It’s more like highstreet wear, you can easily blend
with any situation or mix and match. I also introduced lace and embroidery on tees. I
named them 'lace for gentlemen' and 'embroidery gentlemen'. Tell me about your brand name
and the inspiration for the name? It’s Manic Phase. I never think of it as a disorder
(lol), it’s an experience of feelings of heightened energy, creativity and you feel you're
all-powerful or destined for greatness. As a brand how many pieces do you put out in every
collection? Do you also custom make? I have four sizes in a collection. Each size it’s
only 4 to 6 pieces.I do undertake custom orders. Which retail outlets carry your brand?
Ramp, Beverly Street, Kathyushya by Kathyusha How would you describe your personal style?
Sense is louder than brands and I got my own one which makes me look delicious. What is
the process of creating and marketing your design? I am inspired by black and white
colors, minimal prints and lace and embroidery. I transform them into patterns and
patterns leads me to my design. Most of my designs are inspired by my own thoughts. Who do
you envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? Yes, I
do I have a target market I basically focus on people who are fashion conscious and people
who bold enough to wear what they like. I do think about it too much. There are many
negative comments also but I take them as a motivation. Are you self-taught or did you
study fashion design? I did study fashion but couldn’t complete. I never fully believed in
paper-qualifications. I’ve trusted my inner guts and here I am. What would you say are 5
important items which need to be a man wardrobe? Five? Are you kidding me? Wardrobe
essentials are unlimited. According to your question and my priorities: 1 Pure white shirt
and well-fitted suit & slack 2. well-fitted jeans (blue and black) 3. Manicphase tees 4
Boots, dress shoes 5 Watch Designer – Farzan Sheriff Photographer – Arantha Danu is a

life_fashion90_17_From_Reel_Life_to_Real_Life_The_Impact_of_2020s_TV__Film_on.pdf,"From Reel Life to Real Life: The Impact of 2020s TV & Film on Fashion
Jul 16 2024. From the runways to street style, the influence of popular media on what we
wear has been profound. I myself was recently referring back to the TV show “The Expanse”
(ended in 2022) to justify how its take on future suiting might be inspiring some trends
today. Here’s a look at some of the most influential movies and TV shows in the 2020s so
far that have created fashion trends, and a peek into what 2024 might bring. 1 . Emily in
Paris continued to be a major fashion influencer this decade. The show’s vibrant and
eclectic style, curated by costume designer Patricia Field, brought bold colours and
statement prints to the forefront even in the menswear industry. The character Emily’s
wardrobe alone, filled with eye-catching outfits, inspired many to embrace a more
adventurous and colourful approach to fashion that paved the way for the Barbie movie
Pink-a-palooza that still exists today. Valentino 2022/23 is a great reference for vibrant
colours and bold prints reminiscent of “Emily in Paris.” The playful and eclectic styles
were a hit on the runway and in stores for the brand and even influence local brands right
now. 2. Euphoria has been a game-changer in terms of fashion, particularly among younger
audiences. The show’s unique blend of edgy, glamorous, and sometimes provocative styles
has inspired countless fashion trends. From glittery makeup to bold, experimental outfits,
“Euphoria” has encouraged viewers to express their individuality through fashion. A lot of
US retail brands offer items inspired by Euphoria’s impact on gen-z culture and even fast-
tracked the early 00’s grunge and denim trends in Colombo right now by mass market
retailers. Now with Euphoria set to return soon, its impact on a generation to come is
eagerly anticipated and a visual curiosity for industry experts already commenting on
possible trends that will be seen. 3. Succession introduced the concept of “quiet luxury”
to mainstream fashion. The RoyCo family wardrobes, characterized by simple designs,
neutral colours, and sleek tailoring, epitomized understated elegance for men in an
attractive way. This trend which is commonly known as the “old money” look locally,
emphasizes quality and sophistication without overt branding… at least before fast fashion
brands emulated it to death. Saint Laurent collections in 22/23 are the perfect reference
point to the “quiet luxury” trend now being overdone. Epitomised sleek tailoring, neutral
palettes, and minimalist designs were key features that are still being emulated by
emerging clothing brands in the Insta store sphere on the island. 4. Bridgerton continues
to influence fashion with its “Regencycore” aesthetic with season 3 this year. The show’s
elaborate costumes, featuring corsets, empire waist dresses, and intricate embroidery,
have inspired modern interpretations of historical fashion even though our local ateliers
might deign to admit it. The influence of “Bridgerton” was evident in Dior’s past few
collections, which featured Regency-inspired dresses, corsets, and delicate embroidery;
even in the ateliers’ Indian market expansion. The romantic and historical elements were a
nod to the show’s aesthetic even though brocade was emulated with Zardosi work and
mirrors. 5. House of Gucci , released in late 2021 had a lasting impact on fashion. The
movie’s portrayal of the glamorous and sometimes outrageous fashion of the Gucci family
inspired many to embrace bold, luxurious styles. The film’s influence was evident in
fashion collections that featured opulent fabrics, dramatic silhouettes, and statement
accessories. Inspired by “House of Gucci,” Gucci collections embraced opulence and drama
making waves in the industry. Rich fabrics, intricate details, and statement pieces
central to their design are now even bolder in this year’s offering highlighting their
symbolic significance in culture while also drawing attention to fashion’s ability to
create the extraordinary within the ordinary. As much as Tom Ford can be credited with a
wide peak lapel, Gucci can now be credited with the sweeping emerald to olive suit trend
replacing the aged blue blazer in most men’s wardrobes in town. It’s amazing how movies
and TV shows have always been a significant source of fashion inspiration, and the 2020sare going to be giving us references for decades to come. According to fashion analysts,
the intersection of fashion and popular media is more influential than ever! As we move
into late 2024, we can expect to see a blend of nostalgic and futuristic styles, driven by
the diverse range of shows and films yet to be released. One can only hope the local
options we will rely on will find inspiration rather than click copy and then paste as
they have done many a time. A fashion stylist with a decade of experience as an image

life_fashion90_17_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_Emerging_Designers.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week: Emerging Designers
Feb 25 2022. The emerging designers held the audience in thrall on Day 1 of HSBC Colombo
Fashion Week held at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo. Eight young designers took to the
runway to showcase their collections. Brimming with new ideas on sustainability,
preserving artisanal crafts, using zero-waste patterns and natural dyes the clutch of
emerging designers presented collections that were both sleek and stunning. Ones to watch
included Hashintha Halwala's monochrome collection coupled with his use of pleats was
slick on the runway while Mikhail Hameed, clearly a chip off the old block presented a
collection of menswear which personified street style with a dash of panache. Hirushi
Jayatilake's selection of fabrics added a touch of blingtastic glamour to the runway.
Using a bold colour palette of red and purple coupled with black and white Harinda
Gunawardhana's collection which incorporated batik added a dramatic vibe to the evening.
Akash Paranavithana Fond of creating abstract concepts, he takes something that is not
visible to the naked eye and creates it to something tangible. His brand MAEL CEYLON
focuses on high streetwear and accessories. In this collection, Akash has used zero-waste
patterns, used patchwork and safety pins to reduce waste. Chamanka Hewage His brand
PANTHER espouses the idea of art in fashion and celebrates fashion by connecting many
different backgrounds like music and choreography. This season the collection was designed
based on the street x techwear fashion trends and the entire collection is inspired by the
famous Spanish poem Le Jardin by Jaques Prèvert. Githmi Samarasekara Striving to capture
the uniqueness of Sri Lankan culture as inspiration for this collection Githmi has spun
formal design essence into modern fashion concepts. Her brand Gi focuses on a mix of
formal and casual looks and is an eco-conscious brand. He has used natural dyeing
techniques mainly tea dye, complicated pattern cutting, draping, and tailoring to elevate
her collection. Harinda Gunawardana Using batik in a contemporary abstract manner Harinda
has created a collection that pays homage to power dressing which was popular in the
1980s. He has used eco-friendly fabrics and home-based artisans with a view of helping to
elevate the batik craft sector. His brand HARID fosters self-love and confidence while
promoting the value of being comfortable with oneself. Hashintha Halwala An illustrator by
profession Hashintha was inspired to dip his toes into fashion design after interning
backstage at Colombo Fashion Week. His brand DEV HALWALA consists of activewear. He has
used natural and synthetic fabrics and the garments have varied aesthetic details such as

life_fashion90_17_International_Designers_AT_CFW.pdf,"International Designers AT CFW
Mar 04 2024. Spanning just over two decades, Colombo Fashion Week has earned a reputation
as one of the leading fashion weeks in Asia. Due to this, during each season there is a
clutch of international designers who showcase their collections at CFW adding an
international dimension to the show. This year six designers will be at CFW, namely
Abraham & Thakore, Afsana Ferdousi, Manoviraj Khosla, Payal Pratap, Charlotte
Allen/Klements, and Samant Chauhan. Afsana Ferdousi a designer from Bangladesh describes
her collection as “Emotional Weaves in Khadi Textiles”. She explains further by saying “it
is a captivating collection that weaves emotions into our beloved handloom khadi. Each
piece encapsulates a chapter of the human experience, giving voice to nameless emotions.
From love’s caress to sorrow’s touch, joy’s dance to contemplative stitches, khadi becomes
a canvas for sentiments. Adorned with traditional Bengali clay tepa doll masks crafted
from recycled newspapers, every garment invites wearers to explore their inner emotions
through the artistry of Bangladeshi khadi textiles.” Ferdousi has derived inspiration for
this collection from the beautiful heritage of handloom khadi textiles and the rich
tapestry of human emotions. Using fabric manipulation techniques, Ferdousi aims to capture
the depth of emotions, creating wearable art that celebrates tradition and individual
expression. Adorned with traditional Bengali clay tepa doll masks made from recycled
newspapers, each garment encourages wearers to connect with their inner emotions through
the artistry of khadi textiles. Opining on responsible fashion, a buzzword in the industry
Ferdousi says “Responsible fashion, to me, means creating and consuming fashion in a way
that minimises harm to people, animals, and the planet. It’s about making thoughtful
choices throughout the entire lifecycle of a garment, from sourcing sustainable materials
and ethical manufacturing to reducing waste and promoting fair labour practices.
Responsible fashion is not just about what we wear, but also about the values and
principles behind it, aiming for a fashion world that’s kinder and more sustainable.” Also
showcasing at CFW is Charlotte Allen from Britain whose label is called Klements. Her
Ghost collection is part of her collaboration with London’s Burgh House and comprises a
printed collection of silken womenswear made in London, with hand-painted prints.
Commenting on how she balances commerce with creativity Charlotte says “we keep our
garment shapes simple but ensure our prints are unusual and eye-catching.” Explaining her
sustainability credentials Charlotte explains “We make locally in London in very small
batches to order, working with mainly natural fibres such as silk or organic cotton. Any
spare cloth never goes to waste, we make scrunchies, cover note pads or tote bags. We make
our pieces beautifully and slowly with the idea they should last for decades. We don't try
to follow trends, instead aiming to create timeless special, keeper pieces.” No strangers
to CFW, Indian designer duo Abraham and Thakore also return to CFW where they will
showcase their latest collection Body Language. Inspired by a simple question How do we
communicate today? The designer duo ask if our contemporary world going through a
communication revolution. Chat GPT is gaining steam and the emoji is almost as powerful as
the written word. Abraham & Thakore reflect on this pertinent question. They explore this
through the multilingual medium of textiles. The collection embraces braille, morse code
and ‘conventional’ text. You can find creations that invite you to feel letters, wear
binary codes, and make witty, non-verbal statements. As one of the pioneer design brands
in India Abraham and Thakore place emphasis on sustainability. They have been working with
sustainable materials, and craft processes and engaging with producers who have a small
environmental footprint. Most importantly they believe in creating fashion products with
longevity and in a style that transcends short-term trends. In response to why they keep
returning to CFW the duo reply “Sri Lanka is always inspiring. From its culture, natural
beauty and creativity, we always find something to learn.” The international designerswill showcase their collections on 7th, 8th and 9th March 2024. Tina Edward Gunawardhana

life_fashion90_17_itr_by_Khyati_Pande_At_The_Design_Collective.pdf,"'itr' by Khyati Pande At The Design Collective
Oct 22 2018. Indian fashion designer Khyati Pande, the founder of ‘nnnn’ | ' itr '
(pronounced as it- ra ) will be in Sri Lanka to showcase her latest collection The Memory
Keeper at the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week. Aided by her brand’s presence at The Design
Collective, Pande’s itr is familiar amongst many of Colombo’s discerning fashionistas.
After showcasing her collection at MBFW Sri Lanka, The Design Collective will host a meet
the designer session at their premises on Sunday 28th October from 3-6pm. For lovers of
the itr label this would be the perfect opportunity to meet the designer and see what her
latest collection presents. What brings you to Colombo? -We are debuting at the MBFW Sri
Lanka and will be showcasing the same at The Design Collective What’s the name of the
collection you will be showcasing at The Design Collective The collection is called 'The
Memory Keeper'. It’s a compilation of garments with the basic common thread of thought,
which is to make clothes that keeps one at ease, unrestricted, and unbiased, where clothes
simply layer on to you like a comforting hug. What does this collection comprise? The
collection is crafted from Handwoven Khadi muslin, Khadi silk, hand block printed silk
organza, fused with dainty hand embroidered motifs. Embracing the tranquility of anti fits
, the garment cuts are kept boxy with oversized layers and play of sheer volume to add to
the drama. What inspired you for this collection? As an extension to our SS18, inspired by
a faint lingering sense of summer nostalgia, the collection is drawn from ‘the floral
fragments of pressed flowers beneath the pages of your favourite book’. Using basic and
the most elementary form of patterns seen and used in textiles, the concept is to create
silhouettes which simply slips and layers over like ones own skin, clothes that become a
part of one’s everyday chores. Something that can be worn from 9AM-9PM. What similarities
do you find between your Indian and Sri Lankan clients? Although the buying behaviour of
both the markets is very different, but both are highly receptive to unconventional
designs. What sets you apart from the competition? The aim is to cater to every wardrobe,
that can be borrowed and shared within generations, where styles are not bound by trend,
time, age, size or place, and gives the wearer a freedom to re-define the same in their
own style. The core philosophy is to deliver good designs, impeccable quality, and at a
value that is never disproportionate to the effort that goes into each piece. How
receptive do you find Sri Lankan’s towards your collections? I think Sri Lankan market has
a very liberal approach to experimenting with style, which gives us more width and depth
to craft better refined designs. How has the last year treated you? Being a young budding
brand, the overall response has been quite overwhelming Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

life_fashion90_17_Mystical_Trance.pdf,"Mystical Trance
May 08 2017. Fashion graduate Ranga's collection inspired by doodling Ranga Senavirathe is
a recent graduate of the Open University of Sri Lanka, where he majored in Fashion Design
and Product Development. At the recently concluded graduate show, his collection stood out
due to its diversity in design and fashion forwardness. Ranga used a series of hand
illustrations which were then printed on fabric. A menswear designer and print developer,
Ranga is a talented designer and certainly one to watch out for. What's the new collection
about? This is my university graduation collection which comprised of 6 different looks. I
have used 'hand illustrations' as the main component for this collection. The base of all
the prints that you can see, were hand illustrations that were manipulated by software and
transformed as graphic prints at the end of the process. Do you only do menswear? Yes, I'm
primarily a menswear fashion designer and a print developer. Are you hoping to retail? If
you're asking about this collection, I will not sell these originals for some time because
I want to use them for a few fashion shows I am hoping to participate in. However, I am
looking to recreate these looks for the market in the near future. Apart from that, I'm
looking forward to working with a well reputed brand or investor if I can get the
opportunity. What's the inspiration behind the collection? Doodle art genres was the
inspiration for this collection. Doodle art is also know as a modern form of ancient cave
arts and scribble patterns. Basically, they are based on the feeling of the creator.
Ancient people used this genre to express their feelings as an art. My concept
developments were based on an original sense of ancient cave art with colour blends and
scribble patterns. My attempt was to create a blend of my unique form of doodles and
incorporate it with a high fashion men's sports casual line. What's the collection called?
The theme for this collection is 'Mystical Trance'. I needed to achieve the very same
sense of Alexander McQueen, so this is basically a sense of modern gothic. Why did you
want a career in fashion? Since I have always been interested in art, designing, drawing
and doodling as a child, I was always looking for a path which I can convert those into a
profession someday. Fashion design is a field that incorporates all these skills in a
positive way. Who is your muse? Lee Alexander McQueen. I'm a big fan of his work. To me,
he is one of the greatest designers. I love the way he used his skull motif in fashion.
Who's your style icon? David Beckham. I love the way he has established his name as a
fashion and style icon in the industry while starting his career as a soccer player. Tina

society. This is being implemented at school levels so that the next generation of
designers get used to it since inception thus by creating a new norm, which is of global

life_fashion90_18_CFW_2019_-_Day_2.pdf,"CFW 2019 - Day 2
Feb 28 2019. The fashion flock gathered at the Galle Face Hotel to catch the action on the
ramp on day 2 of HSBC Colombo Fashion Week. Seasoned Sri Lankan designers such as Gihan
Ediriweera, Dimuthu Sahabandu, Dinushi Pamunuwa, Brian Kerkoven, Jaish Jayasinghe and
Amilani Perera were joined by Turkish designer Cigdem Akin. Bold designs and wearable
creations in a profusion of colours dominated the runway on day 2. Artisanal crafts such
as batik and bobbin lace were also out in full force as designers paid homage to
traditional craft forms. Here is what Ajai Vir Singh (Founder and President) and Fazeena
Rajabdeen (Shared CEO and Director) had to say. Day 2 was amazing, it carried the momentum
from Day 1. We saw some strong showing by the designers. CFW started its journey in 2003
at the Galle Face Hotel and having the show here is very special. The architectural
backdrop of the Galle Face Hotel provided a stunning backdrop for Day 2 of CFW. The
designers continue to up their game and this bodes well for fashion in Sri Lanka. Gihan
Ediriweera Veering just slightly away from the tie and dye techniques that are associated
with Gihan, he has bravely stepped up and created some fabulous batik prints paying homage
to florals inspired by Japanese cherry blossoms. A hands on designer who is involved in
every step of creating his batik fabrics, Gihan has played with silhouettes to create
interesting looks for this monochromatic collection. Dimuthu Sahabandu Dimuthu’s forte
lies in his ability to manipulate fabric to create stunning looks. Give him a plain fabric
and he will ruche it, pleat it or just weave his incomparable magic and create a stunning
gown. This collection is no exception. Heavily embellished high fashion clothes with
nuances of Hollywood glamour bring together Dimuthu’s signature style in this collection.
He truly deserves the accolade of being one of Sri Lanka’s finest couture designers.
Dinushi Pamunuwa (La Pard) Keeping her silhouettes simple, soft and feminine, designer
Dinushi has created a collection of instantly wearable clothes. She has taken elements of
lingerie, another of her strong points and infused it into her collection. Using silver
and gold hues her designs created in batik are further embellished with intricate
beadwork. Her designs are simple but the effective use of colour combinations marks her
undeniable signature. Jaish Jayasingha An explosion of colour erupted on the runway from
the moment the first model stepped out on the ramp. Constantly attuned to nature, this
seasoned designer Jaish uses water, a natural element as her inspiration for this
collection. Featuring an abundance of ruffles and frills to demonstrate the fluidity of
water, Jaish has created soft flowing silhouettes and included saris for which she is best
known for. Brian Kerkoven The Kerkoven Girl marks Brian’s successful attempt to create a
collection of fun silhouettes for an adventurous woman. The pieces range from fun to
formal while following a theme right through the collection. He shows his adventurous
streak by using a range of fabrics from chiffons to heavier fabrics to showcase the full
spectrum of his design skill set. Amilani Perera Always inspired by her heritage, in this
collection Amilani Perera uses the Sri Lankan traditional Kandyan folk dance, the Mayura
Wannama as her inspiration. She has used various methods of intricate embroidery to
embellish her fabrics. Her silhouettes are dramatic and the details add visual interest.
This collection is made from 100% cruelty-free vegan materials. Cigdem Akin Turkish
designer Cigdem Akin showcased a collection which contained her leitmotif in different
colours. Her prints were simple but effective. The collection contained a full spectrum of
outfits for men and women. Her colour palette was muted with pops of claret to break up
the pastel shades. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel,

life_fashion90_18_Designer_1-2-1-_Arm_candy_anyone.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1- Arm candy anyone?
Oct 23 2017. This young designer began her career by painting a saree; buoyed up by the
feedback she received, Lasanthi embarked on making customised clutch bags. Soon after, she
founded her label ‘Out of the Box’. Each clutch that she creates is made from upcycled
fabric by a co-operative of women from a rural village in the North West of Sri Lanka. Her
clutches are one of a kind and are definite arm candy for those who seek to carry
something quirky and personal. What made you embark on a career in fashion, especially
bags? ‘Out of the Box’ has a variety of fashion related items, including hand-painted
scarves, designer sarees, tie-dye, beach wear, clutches and totes, but it’s not restricted
to fashion. Our collections include glass and wood-burned décor: the concept is an all-
inclusive store in arts and creative design. All my items have a strong focus on art, and
the fashion items are designed to be pieces of Wearable Art. They are limited and made to
stand out: statement pieces. I do this part time. It started off as a hobby that
flourished into something bigger, but it retained the creative passion and core model of
making art. What is your latest collection called? I’m currently working on a new
collection of artisanal clutches for the holiday season. The new collection itself doesn’t
have a name, but each individual design is named to reflect its inspiration and appeal.
Describe this new collection? The clutches are handmade. They are made from upcycled
fabrics and each clutch is designed individually with meticulous attention to detail.
Therefore, each bag in this collection is unique with its own origin and journey. There’s
often hand-beading, embroidery, or touches of paintwork incorporated into the bags. The
collection consists of diverse styles and moods ranging from the fun and quirky, to chic
elegance. There’s something in there for each temperament and occasion. What is the
ethical element of your brand? I incorporate as much upcycling as possible in each of my
designs. The clutches featured here are all made from beautiful upcycled fabrics. This
makes each design unique to ‘Out of the Box’. As an environmentalist, I always take into
consideration the impact, on natural resources, of the techniques used. For instance, the
tie-dyeing process is specifically devised to reduce and treat resulting waste water.
There’s a community element to my brand too. So, it’s ethically sourced, and ethically
made. How long have you been a designer? I painted my first custom saree in 2012. It was
the overwhelming feedback from this that made me launch ‘Out of the Box’. So, I guess 5
years. I did more custom sarees and soon launched my first collection of clutches. Who
makes your clutch bags? To retain high quality and integrity, the clutches are
individually designed and assembled by me. I work alongside a group of women who are
trained to construct the initial building blocks for the clutches. They are taught basic
skills (e.g. cutting, sewing) and progress gradually, developing proficiency, within the
varying products available through ‘Out of the Box’. Ultimately, they have the ability to
launch their own local small businesses with the skills and revenue acquired while
undergoing the training. Where did you find this cooperative of women? I travel a lot, and
am often based outside of Colombo for work. This presents me the rare opportunity to work
alongside the local community: offering trainings and a source of income to care-givers
who are unable to go into conventional employment. I specifically work with, and to
empower, women in these communities. What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion
business in Sri Lanka? Funding. My business and community aspect is entirely self-funded
so it’s not easy and can be limiting. This is a personal challenge I’ve faced. I think
it’s also challenging to create something new and exciting, constantly. It’s easy to get
comfortable - complacent with where you are creatively and risk losing the passion you
have for what you do. This trickles down into what you create. The name of my brand was
specifically chosen to remind myself not to get stale: To keep innovating, to always think
“Out of the Box”. Where do you retail your stuff? I retail mainly via my Facebook andInstagram pages (@OutOfTheBox.lk). I also sometimes retail at events and markets,
including the Good Market. What is your top accessory? The artisanal statement clutches.
Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? I’m a “browser”. I like to rummage through small
shops and markets for hidden gems. I’ve found a lot of really nice and unusual pieces from
a variety of shops. Fashion prediction for the next season? I think people will start
wearing more individual pieces that reflect who they are, rather than going for mass
markets, and that’s what my statement accessories and fashion items aim for. There’s been
an influx of small businesses, and lesser known designers doing really well. I think this
is a reflection of where fashion in Sri Lanka is headed. People are tired of blending in:
they want to shine. Who would you like to see carrying your bags? Beyonce and Rihanna!
Jokes aside, I design my items for strong women. People with assured personalities, who
know who they are and aren’t apprehensive to show it. Those who want to stand out and make
a bold statement about their identity, whatever it may be. To own it! There’s nothing more
vogue than “being you”, with confidence. How many styles of bags do you create? I
currently have two models of totes, and my signature clutch. In terms of style though,
each item is restricted in quantity. So, for example, when I release 40 clutch designs for
the Christmas Season 2017, EACH is a distinct style. Each bag has a different persona,
vibe, and history behind it. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

Sep 10 2018. A champion of recycling and upcycling, Lonali Rodrigo has unveiled her latest
collection Be You . Lonali has a knack for creating wearable fashion from discarded fabric
and trims. A designer who thinks out of the box, Lonali has always championed the cause of
recycling and upcyling and her brand has grown from strength to strength. Name of
designer: Lonali Rodrigo Name of brand : l o n a l i Name of collection: BE YOU What
inspired this collection? Unique stories and characters of our youth inspired me to create

you source your fabrics and materials from? As always we have given new life to beautiful
discards from our apparel industry. How many collections do you create per season/year? We

got new arrivals every month. What differentiates your clothes from other designers? House
of Lonali is known for up-cycling which is the key differentiator. We do this without
compromising on style. How ethically savvy do you think Sri Lankan fashion consumers are?
We see a clear increase in ethical consumerism in Sri Lanka and this is a very good sign
for the country and the industry. What are the key themes you have concentrated on for
this collection? We have used a contemporary colour palette with shades of blue with a
hint of maroon and red for this collection. Silhouettes in this collection are trendy and
vary from straight to fitted waist with tees that can be tucked in or out. You will see a
mix of stripe and check fabrics across the collection with the most interesting being the
double cloth which we have used for reversible outfits. There is an array of both
floral and ethnic prints in some pieces that gives a chic metropolitan look if you pair
it. Talk us through your creative process We look for pre-consumer apparel discards from
the industry and based on these we develop products and styles to suit our consumers. Our
inspiration comes from people, places, aesthetics and the environment. These moments are
then captured in our collections. Where do you retail your products? At theDesign
Collective. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

Oct 20 2020. Torn between a career in engineering and fashion design, enterprising Akhila
managed to complete degrees in both. Hailing from a family where producing garments was
their bread and butter it was a no brainer that Akila would follow her father’s footsteps
and venture forth into the fashion industry. A past student of AOD, Akhila worked as a
designer for fashionmarket.lk while working on creating her own eponymous label. What
sparked your interest in fashion design? Ever since I remember I was always hanging around
my mother even when she was dressing up. That inspired me to imitate how she styled her
outfits and matched the accessories and put them together. My mom’s wardrobe inspired me
to design new outfits for my Barbie dolls when I was a kid. I always wanted my Barbies to
look more stylish and never let them wear the outfits which were given to them. I also
used to see my father measuring and designing various types of garments. With time I
realized, fashion designing has been something that’s been running in my blood. How has
your work evolved since you began your own label? I used to design my own outfits whenever
I went to a special occasion and the majority of colleagues started asking where I bought
them. Having known I was the designer of my own outfits my friends wanted me to design
their outfits as well. Then I realized that there were customers who were willing to buy
the products I designed as well. This was the very first step which led me to start my own
brand. Also, while I was working at fashionmarket.lk, I had enough freedom to come up with
my own concepts and see them evolve into products. Are there any types of clothing that
you avoid designing? Not at all. Whatever the material or the clothing type maybe through
my experience and the knowledge I can simply design and approach because I love to
experiment with new things and don’t want to specifically avoid designing any type of
clothing. Where do you look for creative inspiration? No need to go further, walk into the
street or to the garden or whatever the place where you live. You may find countless
amounts of creative inspirations which may inspire you to come up with fresh concepts. I
simply look for circumstances in progress where new trends and design opportunities are
being created. Describe your latest collection? My latest tropical fruit inspired
collection named “Holiday Escape” includes sunny tropical dresses, t-shirts, and tops full
of unique and on-trend pieces mixed with Sri Lankan typography elements and Pop Art
inspired fruit prints that you’ll want to wear right through next year. It has played
around with styles in lengths, fruity prints, batik streaks and out of the box styling
with basic and statement pieces combined. What are you fascinated by at the moment and how
does it feed into your work? In Sri Lankan society there is a huge gap in local-oriented
fashion design. In order to fill the gap, I usually love to design things that are
inspired by Sri Lankan culture and mixed them together with international inspirations.
What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your company? You
really need to build up new connections with and support from industry professionals in
order to establish your name in the field. You should always try to expand the connections
in the field no matter whatever the level they are because the experience they have gained
in the industry is the most important thing that you can learn from someone. What role do
you think social media plays in fashion today? The contribution of media is poor but
occasionally media promotes some programmes based on this subject but that’s not adequate
enough from my point of view when compared to other countries. Our media plays a very
limited role. How do you want women to feel when wearing your clothes? I want them to feel
confident when they wear my clothes because every single piece of my collection is special
because I am aware of the struggle I went through to come up with the final product. So,
every woman who wears my clothes should feel how special and unique they are. Tina Edward

life_fashion90_18_Floral_Feathery_and_Fearless_New_Era_of_Bridal_Fashion_in_Sr.pdf,"Floral, Feathery, and Fearless: New Era of Bridal Fashion in Sri Lanka
Jul 30 2024. The mid-year wedding season might be ending, but workshops and bridal
designer studios in Colombo are abuzz with activity thanks to a certain event to showcase
their skills. There is anticipation and wide speculation on whether the bastions will
uphold standards, the more avantgarde will deliver shock and awe, some might even be
openly wondering if the stalwarts of style might be still pushing their dated expressions
on mothers vicariously living through their poor daughters along for the ride. An emerging
economy of sorts some would say. Well no matter, as a Stylist, my advice to many was keep
it relevant to today and I hope Brides and the Bridal Market both evolve in taste and
design. The bridal industry in Sri Lanka rarely veers off tradition. Grooms rarely
question what is thrown on them to compliment. But there is emerging the Gen-Z couple with
frugal outlooks on materials and events. Here are some of the thoughts steering global
trends right now. Mini-mising the Dress Everything’s going mini this year, from bouquets
to cakes and even dresses. Imagine your girls wearing corsages, and even a little purse to
accompany your mini wedding dress. As the Bride of today and possibly tomorrow lives in a
fast fashion world, a mini dress that can be brought off a website and re-worn appeals
better than the investment of a dress custom-made to be worn only once. An alternative to
this trend has to be the mini dress that comes with a detachable skirt or layer so it
becomes a mini later in the evening. Bold, Yet Refined Use of Colour This year, weddings
are all about bold colours. But don’t worry, it’s not about being flashy. The use of
colour is thoughtful and refined, adding a touch of personality to your big day. It could
simply be the décor or the varying tones of your bridesmaids in your favourite colour; not
your mothers. There are no do’s and don’ts when it's your big day and you’re dishing out
the cash. Generally, Sri Lankan brides reach for…… some interesting themes and colour
schemes, but the new generations are basing their decisions on Pinterest boards rather
than for auspicious reasons. I see this very clearly with their second change for the day
in silk print or batik dresses that are becoming very popular. Flowers for Jewellery Ring
stacks and non-precious jewellery are becoming quite the norm for bridal adornment, and
The Knot – a bridal authority online swears that floral themed jewellery is now set to
become a brides strongest preference. Floral everything is making a huge comeback this
year overall. Bold earrings with large flower petal-shaped studs and dangle styles are at
the pinnacle of this trend. Floral elements being featured in the garments with embroidery
and embellishment is slowly emerging as a trend on its own adding a bit of fantasy and
whimsy to the ensemble. There was also an instance where the Ambani wedding had a dupatta
made of fresh flowers. Non-traditional Necklines Against the unsolicited advice of
aunties, the Fashion World seems to be experimenting with necklines that are usually
chaste offerings that could pass in church or hotel. From Ellie Saab to Vivienne Westwood
they have taken many shapes and dips. The conservative solution has been the addition of a
lace high neck that even deals with the need for Jewellery unless hidden. From sharp
plunges to cat eye curves, necklines are under construction no matter who clutches their
imaginary pearls. Feathering a Ton Move over pearl and crystal embellishment, there is a
new must have ‘work’ in town, and we are not limiting it to trimming alone. Both in guest
wear as well as the Bride, feather trim, attachment and features are slowly emerging as a
notable trend inspired by the roaring 20s. As much as I reference this with couture
dresses by Nardos & Ines Di Santo, my most favourite expression has been seeing it on a
saree yet to grace our society features, but it's coming soon. With these quick tips, I am
very excited to see the Bride (and perhaps, the Groom) of tomorrow exemplifying these
trends. But progress will be made when the outfits are made for a Bride willing to
understand the significance of picking a designer or design studio based on the match to
brief rather than a match to name or fame. One can only hope for a better tomorrow. Photocredits: Instagram A fashion stylist with a decade of experience as an image expert and

life_fashion90_18_HSBC_CFW_2022_-_Green_Conscious_and_Earth_Sensitive.pdf,"HSBC CFW 2022 - Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive
Feb 22 2022. In a pandemic which has caused the world to slow down its pace and re-think
its priorities, Colombo Fashion Week has adopted a theme of Green Conscious and Earth
Sensitive. At its very core the new season will place special emphasis on societal and
environmental wellbeing. Scheduled to take place from 24th- 26th February CFW will
showcase a selection of Emerging Designers alongside established Sri Lankan designers.
Adding international flavour will be well known designers from India Suket Dhir, Urvashi
Kaur and Zaheer Abbas from Pakistan. Flying the flag for Sri Lanka are Achala Leekoh,
Amilani Perera, Charini Suriyage, Dimuthu Sahabandu, Divya Jayawickrame, Fouzul Hameed,
Himashi Wijeweera, Indi Yapa Abeywardene, Kamil Hewavitharana, Lovi Ceylon, Nilusha
Maddumage and Sonali Dharmawardene. One of the most eagerly anticipated segments of CFW
are the Emerging Designers. Under the guidance of The Emerging Designers include the
dynamic Akarsh Paranavithana, Harinda Gunawardene, Mikhail Hameed amongst Chamanka Hewage,
Githmi Samarasekera, Hashintha Halwala, Hirushi Jayatilake and Prasadi Weerakkodi. They
will be vying for the coveted Italian Award for High Potential Emerging Designer at
Colombo Fashion Week and the HSBC Fashion Fund for Emerging Designers. One of the biggest
issues faced by the emerging designers is the cost of raw materials. The HSBC Fashion Fund
aims to help rejuvenate and spur creativity and innovation within Sri Lanka’s fashion and
design industry which has faced severe challenges since 2020 with newcomers facing
business closures and other hardships. Commenting on CFW’s Emerging Design Programme
Founder and President of CFW Ajai Vir Singh said ““Our Emerging Designer programme is very
personal to me and remains one of our most important initiatives. We embarked on it very
early on in our journey as there weren’t many designers when we began in 2003. Thus,
developing design talent became a priority and has remained so till now, and it will
continue to remain so for the foreseeable future, as Sri Lanka is a growing and emerging
market in terms of fashion design. We hope to gain more traction for this initiative in
2022, and move to even bigger things in the future.” One of the highlights this season is
expected to be the collaboration between CFW and Sri Lanka’s oldest conservation body
established in 1894, the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society of Sri Lanka to celebrate
Colombo’s wetlands marking World Wetland Day and WNPS’s Wetland Month alongside the glitz
and glamour of Fashion Week. This season is the second year that UNFPA partners with CFW
to bring attention to sexual and gender-based exploitation of women. The fashion industry
boasts of healthy women participation in its supply chain, making them important
stakeholders. This aspect of societal wellbeing plays an important role in arresting this
exploitation. Designer Amilani Perera integrates this aspect in her collection which will
be shown at CFW. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_18_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_Day_3.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week Day 3
Mar 25 2018. Day 3 of the HSBC Colombo Fashion Week 2018 for Spring/Summer ’19 took place
on the 24rd of March at Hilton Colombo. Sri Lankan and international designers showcased
their creations to an audience of fashion lovers. Bold designs in various hues and
silhouettes were sent down the runway. The show crescendoed into a series of dazzling
outfits which showcased the high standard of fashion. Speaking to Founder and President
Ajai Vir Singh about Day 3 he tells us that “ Day 3 began with the iconic Bibi Russell who
is such a global figure. We are privileged to have shown her collection every year
inspiring Sri Lankan designers. Dimuthu Sahabandu, Charini, Conscience and Darshi, what a
strong Sri Lankan line up and a finale with another icon Hemant Trivedi. You could not
probably ask more for a day 3!” Bibi Russell Known for creating drama through colour, Bibi
presented a collection in varied hues of green. Her collection was created especially for
the 15th anniversary of CFW. Using handwoven fabric, Bibi, showcased a collection that
stayed true to her design ethos. Her accessories also complemented the collection. For
Bibi, fashion more than anything is about empowering the rural artisan communities she
works with and showcasing their talents to the world. Charini Creating her own fabrics has
become a forte that Charini is fast gaining a reputation for. This season, the epic poem
“Salalihini Sandeshaya” provided the inspiration for the fabrics she created. Each piece
contained Charini’s interpretation of scenes from the poem. Sarees, dresses, skirts and
blouses with exaggerated sleeves formed the mainstay of her collection. ""I like to relate
stories through my collection and this time I had a solid inspiration in the form of the
Salalihini Sandeshaya. I allowed my fabric and silhouettes to relate the story.” Fouzul
Hameed A pioneer in men’s tailoring in Sri Lanka, Fouzul Hameed presented a stunning
menswear collection. Inspired by his travels, Italian architecture, atmosphere,
environment and people played a role in helping Fouzul Hameed design this collection. His
three collections, De Rigueur, Contemporary and Celebrate life were a celebration of the
modern man. The three collections were fresh sharp and exactly what the modern Sri Lankan
man need. “I used a variety of cotton, linen and wool to create this collection” Dimuthu
Sahabandu A stunning collection that proves with each season Dimuthu keeps upping the
ante. The way he manipulates the fabric to create new textures and designs is a testimony
to his design vision. A man of few words, Dimuthi lets his creations do the talking!. And
what a conversation it made. Inspired by the story of Joan of Arc, Dimuthu’s collection
portrays the journey from peasant girl to a warrior woman. The silhouettes were strong but
at the same time, they had a delicate air of femininity to it. Dimuthu has stayed true to
his signature style with lots of drapes and structure. The silk chiffons, georgette and
mesh fabric ranged from hues of white and metallics to deep ox blood. “ I always try to
create a collection where there is something for everyone and in this collection I have
done just that. ” Ponds In keeping with the au natural trend in make-up, Pallavi Symons
created some fresh faced looks for Ponds.The looks ranged from day to evening using a
combination of contouring, and highlighting which are the current trends. “ In conjunction
with the Ponds team, we created looked that are relevant to current trends” Conscience
Ever conscious about the environment, Conscience presented a collection that worked with
the depth and simplicity of the colour black. Black in this collection is the absence of
colour, but still manages to relate a colourful story. The emotional language of the
colour is represented in the silhouettes that are pushed beyond the conventional. The
philosophy of the brand which is to create the supply chain of happiness is represented in
this collection which uses a combination of handwoven, upcycled, recycled fabrics and zero
waste pattern. “Conscience uses the depth of the colour black to create silhouettes that
push boundaries. It focuses on renewed life to clothes and zero waste as they are the key
parameters of this collection. It also focuses on longevity” Buddhi Batiks Darshi,combined her childhood memories with her desire to blur the lines of race and send a
strong message for peace through her collection. Responsible for creating a renaissance in
the batik industry, designer Darshi was inspired by childhood memories of her garden. She
was also inspired by the work created by Yumi Okita who creates textile sculptures of
butterflies. Using vibrant colours and her signature floral designs, Darshi also
incorporated butterflies into her fabric designs. Her silhouettes varied from fitting to
flowy and her colour palette was vibrant in keeping with the tropical vibe of Sri Lanka.
“I think we are lucky to have a voice to stop violence and I used this collection to
spread that message” Hemant Trivedi Undoubtedly one of India’s foremost and most important
fashion designers, Hemant Trivedi’s collection was an apt finale to day 3 of Colombo
Fashion Week. Collaborating with artisan communities in his native India, Hemant’s
collection of simple fabrics were made dazzling by his exquisite use of appliqué.
Harnessing the purity of the colour white, this formal fusion collection had intricate
patterns appliquéd on it to create a luxe look to the collection. His collection had many
seductive moments as the look and feel of the clothes he sent down the runway showed his
ability to transform a simple piece of cloth into a stunning garment. See all pics here:

life_fashion90_18_Street_Style_Naomi_Wijemanne.pdf,"Street Style: Naomi Wijemanne
Nov 20 2017. Look 1 : TROPICAL This look gives me tropical, Afropunk fest vibes. Ripped
jeans from FashionNova, Floral Crop top from Odel, paired with the tribal silver earrings,
and a fishtail braid to tie it all together. LOOK 2 – CHIC I’ ve paired my black ripped
jeans with a basic strappy grey tank top and added a faux leather jacket, to complete the
look. You could add a choker and some rings for an extra pop LOOK 3: CASUAL Lately, I have
been LOVING graphic tees. I think they’re funny and instantly draw attention to your
outfit! This adorable BaeWatch piece from Zaful got quite a few giggles, and was so much
fun to wear. (P.S - It’s a swimsuit, which I doubled up as a bodysuit! Shhh! Don’t tell
anyone.) LOOK 4 : – NIGHT I’m a hat person, and I really love this wide brim hat, paired
with the black felt tassle bag, and black felt open-toe boots. And I’m really into wearing
big hoop earrings of late. LOOK 5: DRESSY Black on Black with Nude Heels. A classic. Black
velvet pants from New Look and A deep V bodysuit from H&M. Low key sexy, but still super
comfy! It can be done! Style Role Model: Ashley Graham! Because she’s a total babe. And
because s tyle is about more than just what you wear, but about the confidence with which
you can rock that look! Her take on body positivity and confidence has helped me go beyond
limitations I had set for myself. Doesn't matter what size you are, if you've got the
right attitude, you can slay all day. Favourite Colours to Pair: I wear a lot of black,
deep blues and reds, but I love to throw in a bright splash of colour now and then; a
bright red or yellow, or a fun little print to keep things interesting. Go To Outfit: High
waisted jeans (a curvy girl’s best friend), a crop top or bodysuit, and heels. Style Must
H aves? The perfect pair of jeans! (Yes, they do exist.) Make-up Tips? : Personally, I
always try to make sure my eyeliner is on point! Also, before the matte lipsticks rose to
fame, I would always make any lipstick matte by adding a little powder over the first coat
of lipstick, and then reapplying. Works like a charm, and also your lipstick stays on
forever! Style Nos: The only style no-no I can think of is wearing stuff that doesn't fit
you well. Wear whatever the hell you want, but make sure the fit is right, because a well-
fitted garment can do wonders for your body.Oh, and don’t wear crocs. Or sandals with
socks. (Hey, that rhymed.) Style Tip: Have lots of basics! Having a bunch of basic pieces
in your wardrobe means multiple mix and match opportunities. You can style a basic outfit
so many different ways using different accessories; add a hat, maybe? Or a bag. Or wear
your hair different! Dress it up with heels, or dress it down with a cute pair of high top
sneakers. The opportunities are endless, really. So just have fun with it, and don't be
afraid to experiment with looks until you find something that feels right to you.

life_fashion90_19_Big_Bold__Eccentric_The_Rise_of_Maximalism.pdf,"Big, Bold & Eccentric: The Rise of Maximalism
Mar 11 2025. The Minimalist king is dead, long live Maximalism! You saw it creeping in
with the overloaded bag charms and the stacked Taylor Swift concert bracelets, Maximalist
fashion is having its moment in the spotlight, and honestly, it’s about time. After years
of being told that “less is more,” the pendulum has swung the other way, and now it’s all
about “more is more.” Maximalism isn’t just about wearing bold colours or piling on
accessories; it’s a mindset. It’s about embracing individuality, celebrating creativity,
and rejecting the monotony of minimalism. From the runways of Paris & even Colombo Fashion
Week, maximalism is making waves, and it’s not just a trend - it’s a cultural movement.
Designers like Marc Jacobs and Schiaparelli led the charge with collections that were
unapologetically extravagant with voluminous silhouettes, intricate beading, and layers
upon layers of texture much like Lovi & Charini debuted this year. But why now? After
years of minimalist dominance, where clean lines and neutral tones reigned supreme, people
were ready for something different. Minimalism, while aesthetically pleasing, often felt
restrictive to people craving the opportunity for self-expression and adding a little
something extra, something that was uniquely them. It was like being told to whisper when
you wanted to shout, and boy! Is the world of fashion getting loud! Pop culture has always
been a reflection of the times, and in 2024 and 2025, it’s been a maximalist dream. Take
the music industry, for example. Artists like Dhee, our very own Umaria, Doja Cat and
Harry Styles have been pushing the boundaries of fashion with their bold, eclectic looks.
Doja’s 2024 Met Gala outfit, a dazzling mix of feathers, sequins, and metallics, was a
masterclass in maximalism. Harry Styles, known for his gender-fluid fashion, continued to
blur the lines with his 2025 tour wardrobe, featuring everything from glittering jumpsuits
to oversized ruffled shirts. Then there’s the film and TV industry. The 2024 release of
projects like The Substance, The Leopard & Wicked, all played into maximalist trends –
let’s not forget the many press appearances of the dynamic duo from the latter movie.
TikTok is the biggest barometer for the trend; The platform has been a breeding ground for
maximalist trends, with creators showcasing their “clashing but cohesive” outfits and DIY
statement pieces. The hashtag #MaximalistFashion has racked up millions of views, proving
that people are hungry for bold, unapologetic style. Social media influencers on all
platforms were mixing patterns like pros, and even the sleekest Instagram feeds were
embracing a little chaos. So how does one dress maximalist? Mix Patterns & Textures:
Stripes with florals? Polka dots with animal prints? Yes, yes, and yes. The trick is to
play with colour families—find a shared hue to tie it all together. Mix velvet with denim,
sequins with leather, or satin with knits. Different fabrics together give your look that
“wow” factor. Make Every Accessory a Statement: Statement earrings, chunky necklaces,
stacked bracelets, funky rings—go wild. In maximalism, there’s no such thing as “too
much.” Statement Shoes Always Win: Add some quirky kicks—platform boots, holographic
sneakers, or jewel-encrusted heels. Let your shoes scream personality. Don’t Be Shy with
Colours: Bold is beautiful. Embrace neon greens, electric blues, hot pinks, and vibrant
oranges. Or, go all in with a monochrome outfit in a striking shade. Maximalist Fashion is
bold, unapologetic and so appropriate for the current time and space we live in right now.
It celebrates the individual, encouraging the spotlight to find you at your most
authentic, even if it’s just an extra chain over a minimal outfit. You do you. And then go
a little further, just to be you. A fashion stylist with a decade of experience as an
image expert and consultant to local retail brands, Gayantha offers candid advice to men

life_fashion90_19_Creating_Your_Signature_Style.pdf,"Creating Your Signature Style
Mar 07 2018. Living in a society where fashion and appearance plays a definitive role it
is important that you create a signature style. This should be a look that defines your
personality and makes you stand apart from the rest. Creating a signature style can be
expressed in so many ways from the clothes and accessories to a hairstyle and perfume that
you wear. A requisite of creating a signature style is that you have to know who you are
so that you can express yourself honestly and comfortably. The second in a series of
articles commissioned by fashionmarket.lk to celebrate their Women’s Day campaign, ‘Wear
your super power’ (#wearyoursuperpower) for women who believe that they are not ordinary.
This article is about creating your signature style. In order to creating a wardrobe that
represents you, the first step is to understand the various elements of your signature
style. Where you live, your body type, your personality, hair and eye colour all come into
play when devising your signature style. The key to creating your signature style is to
embody a style that is true to who you are and most importantly what you believe in. There
are five main types of style which are Classic, Chic, Whimsical, Bohemian and Avant Garde.
Classic is defined as simple, clean and traditional pieces which project a timeless look
because the silhouette and colours rarely change. Chic is recognized as a powerful look
combined with sharp lines that come together effortlessly. These looks are often
monochromatic and combined with bold accessories. Whimsical is a playful and fun look that
appears to be thrown together but actually is a thoughtful combination of colours and
patterns. The look here is young at heart, ethereal and romantic. Bohemian is defined as
relaxed, lived-in or funky while incorporating quirky accessories. Textural and earthy
fabrics form the mainstay of this collection. Avant Garde is a look that is often
architectural, edgy and ultramodern. A look where the wearer makes a dramatic statement.
Natalie Goonetilleke, a designer at Fashionmarket.lk describing the elements a person has
to consider when figuring out their signature style says “silhouette is the key elements.
Find out the silhouettes which best suit your body shape. Once you know the silhouette
that suits you then change the hemline, colour and prints. Designer Senani Wickramasinghe
believes that it is important to do a trend research and pick out a few words to describe
your style as that will help you clarify and define your signature style. Speaking further
on finding out your signature style designer Shehani De Silva says “you have to know your
body type. Additionally, you have to be comfortable and confident in with who you are and
what you wear” Creating a signature style is a process of experimentation, research and of
course perfecting it with an element of trial and error. It is ultimately your personality
that will pull the look together. Be true to yourself and wear what mostly represents you.
When you are comfortable with what you wear you will be at your most confident and that is
indeed a winning combination! #WearYourSuperpower by Fashionamrket.lk is for all women who
believe that they are not ordinary. It’s for the woman who is adventurous, inspirational
and who is also kind enough to make things better for someone else. It’s for the Bold and
the courageous kind who has what it takes to be a superheroine. #WearYourSuperpower will
be a user generated campaign for women to own this and embrace it. The campaign is active

Dec 30 2020. Having launched her brand Mendes in 2018 Sajee had made great strides in
Colombo’s fashion sphere. Her designs are fresh, cool and convey a sense of joy de vivre
that embodies Sajee’s personality. What sparked your interest in fashion design? I wanted
to have a career in the creative industry. For me, it was either interior or fashion.
However, my love for clothes and the change in seasons, style and clothes made me choose
fashion design as a career. On top of everything, I have always been seriously in love
with the idea of becoming a fashion designer. What made you take fashion more seriously
and make a career out of it? Following my childhood dream, when I started my education as
a fashion student in 2011, I learnt how serious and hardworking this industry really is.
Many see only the glamorous side of the fashion industry from the outside, but it really
is a serious industry that needs a lot of hard work to make that glamour happen. Most
people are not aware of the hard process that it takes to make a proper brand name and
become successful in this industry. Are you self-taught or did you study fashion design?
It is a creative industry. Therefore, it is quite impossible to become a fashion designer
without being self-taught. It’s all about how creative you are. There is no book or
formula to say what is right. We have to keep updating ourselves and let the creativity
spark from inside. However, creativity alone would not help you make your ideas come out,
you need the technical knowledge, methodologies, experience and a lot of inspiration. For
me, studying at AOD under their guidance was the path to make my dream a reality. How has
your work evolved since you began your own label? It has been a very short period since I
started and I have done only a few exclusive collections to ensure that I put the right
designs out. In any creative industry having the right pace is the answer. With every
single collection I have done, it made me a better designer and a better creative
entrepreneur. Each mistake is an opportunity to learn something new, something you will
not learn from a book or a school. With many lessons learnt, today I have managed to bring
the label to where it is now. Yet much more mistakes to make, lessons to learn and success
to achieve in the future. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? I have
been a vegetarian for the past 15 years and I have strong principles towards animal
cruelty and sustainable living. I have never and in the future do not intend to use silk
or leather made out of animal fur in the garments I design. Where do you look for creative
inspiration? My aesthetic when it comes to my brand is minimal. I look at trends from
international catwalks to old Ceylon paintings and carvings and art for inspiration. Also,
I am very fascinated with the change in the style of clothing that happened after every
invasion in the history of Sri Lanka and colonization. Describe your latest collection?
The new collection aesthetic is a minimal colour palette and soft linen silhouettes with
hemlines, that is long with easy fit, and slits. Designed with jacquard details, strong
tailoring in pieces that fits to every occasion. We also have designed a few batik pieces
with linen with simple patterns by working with traditional batik artisans of Sri Lanka.
Who is your muse? This changes from time to time with the mood of the season. Now, at this
moment. I find Queen Rania of Jordan’s style to be quite interesting. What are your
sustainability credentials? My sustainable guideline always follows on working with local
craftsman communities on textile developments and my strong policy of vegan textiles. As a
commercial sustainable practice, we have also reduced the use of single-use Polybags in
packaging and garment deliverers. What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it
feed into your work? I am fascinated with minimal style. Living through the post-covid-19
era, being stuck in one place made me difficult to breathe and made me realize that we are
dangerously overproducing and over-consuming everything. From fashion, to food, to
everything in human lifestyle is a constant competition. I found a way out of it by
sticking to ‘simple living’ which I am currently obsessed with. It sure reflects on mywork as well. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your
company? How to survive on my own and to take constructive criticism without
disappointment. What’s your motto? Break the rules, Live your life! Which international or
local designers are you inspired by? Internationally I look at all the designers I could
think of from Alexander McQueen to Victoria Beckham for inspiration. There’s so much to
learn from every designer out there regardless of the fame or the type of design. What
role do you think social media plays in fashion today? The whole world has changed with
social media. It is a positive change for me as I see it and how I utilize it. Tina Edward

life_fashion90_19_Swim_Week_Colombo_2018_Kicks_Off_With_ART_CONNECT.pdf,"Swim Week Colombo 2018 Kicks Off With ’ART CONNECT’
Jun 30 2017. After its successful inauguration at the Colombo Fashion Week in March 2017,
‘ART CONNECT’ took place for its second consecutive time on Tuesday evening at Trace City
Maradana to launch Swim Week Colombo 2018. The location of regenerated railway warehouses
lent itself well to the occasion. This year, Swim Week Colombo has introduced a new global
position for themselves under the theme ‘Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive’. This new
position was then seeped in this edition of Art Connect under the theme ‘Revive’ as
artists focused on expressing their ideas on green conscious and sustainability. Speaking
to the CEO of Swim Week Colombo, Fazeena Rajabdeen, she tells us ""There is a deep
relationship between art and fashion. Both are an expression of creativity but the
canvases of expression are different. There are times when both come together too. This
season of Art Connect has 6 important artists express the main theme ""Green Conscious and
Earth Sensitive"" through their sensibility thereby giving this cause another dimension of
expression. Also during this week we want to showcase related creative industries and
their connection with fashion."" Founder and President of Colombo Fashion Week, Ajai Vir
Singh was thrilled to be hosting this platform for the second time, ""The artists have
taken it upon themselves to interpret the main theme of Swim Week Colombo, expressing it
through their eyes, mind and heart. It always becomes more meaningful when the
collaboration is way deeper than the surface. It should from the heart and that is what is
happening with this exhibitition. It’s always amazing to showcase the creative industries
and their collaborations."" Chathurika Jayani Having completed her Bachelor of Fine Arts at
the University of Visual and Performing Arts in Colombo, Jayani has taken part in numerous
group exhibitions locally and internationally. Her use of mixed media to create a layered
three dimensional visual on canvas establishes a story in both dimension and texture. She
is known for her intricate detailing and creative methodology in her art. Her work for Art
Connect is titled ‘Escape’ and is a continuation of her previous exhibition ‘Slums’. Here,
she attempted to capture bolts of freedom in the lives of people living in slums of
Colombo with the use of recycled corrugated sheets and burnt wood. A splash of colour was
used to depict that despite the lack of facilities, luxuries and wealth their lives are
still full of colour. ""I believe fashion and art can be two separate entities but there
are occasions when they join together. My art is all made out of recycled items and sits
well with the theme of the exhibition"" Mahen Perera Trained in multi-disciplinary design
at the National Design Centre in Colombo, Mahen later received his BA in Fine Arts from
Lasalle College of Arts (Singapore) in affliation with the Open University, UK. In 2007 he
was awarded the prestigious Winston Oh Travel Award which led him to take a month long
residency in Prague. He has hosted exhibitions internationally in both Singapore and
Vietnam. His work centers on issues of identity and representation with the use of objects
and material detritus. His collection for Art Connect explored the in-between aspects of
materiality and the realm of detritus in society. With a variety of material such as drift
wood, rubber tubes, used cloth, newspapers and food dyes, his art built up narratives
referencing history, sexuality, time and memory. ""Colombo Fashion Week always lends an
exciting and an engaging ""Space"" that provokes to celebrate one’s creative sensibilities
while re-adresing contemporaneity in new perspectives. It has always been a great joy to
be a part of this ever-evolving journey"". Vajira Gunawardena A visiting lecturer at the
University of the Visual and Performing Arts-Sri Lanka, he is a Fine Arts graduate of the
Institute of Aesthetic Studies (University of Kelaniya) and holds a Diploma on product
design from the Designing Department with the Cottage and Textile Industries Department -
Sri Lanka. His work has been in galleries in Sri Lanka and abroad. His work concentrates
largely on politics, culture and history using figurative forms, assemblage and stencil
techniques. His pieces for Art Connect was made with recycled timber together with imagesfrom discarded magazines, children’s books, brochures to draw urban graphics related to
conscious fashion. ""This exhibition has afforded me a great platform to explore fashion
and art using recycled materials such as wooden pallets, newspaper and textiles"" Ajith
Susantha Having completed his Bachelor of Fine Arts at the Institute of Aesthetic Studies,
University of Kelaniya, and his work were exhibited in the UK, Sweden and Sri Lanka. He
specializes in abstract art and installation art collages with paper mediums and uses
recycle paper in his work. At Art Connect, he showcased his talents at abstract art and
installation art with the use of recycled mixed media in light of the Green Conscious
theme. ""Opportunities like these are excellent for artists like myself to showcase my
work. In keeping with the theme I have used recycled paper, coffee, charcoal and some
acrylics to create my work"" Banadu Manamperi One of Sri Lanka’s first performance artists,
Banadu holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Sculpture, is a lecturer and a core member of
Colombo’s Theertha Artists’ Collective. His work is based largely on sculpture, drawing,
painting and installation art. He is known for connecting his performances with his
drawing with the use of print techniques such as screen printing, mono prints and other
unorthodox methods. At Art Connect, Banadu exhibited two themes, ‘Dirty Cloths’ and ‘6
Months Off a Diary’. His exhibition ‘Dirty Cloths’ used an old piece of his clothing along
with other textiles to make screen and relief prints on them. The other exhibition
presented a collage made with recycled paper from a personal journal. ""Fashion is a form
of art. These painting have an abstract element relating to fashion which give different
interpretations"" Anoma Wijewardene An alumna of Central St Martin’s College, University of
the Arts, London, she has exhibited extensively locally and internationally in Sotheby’s
Gallery, Hong Kong; The Affordable Art Fair, London, The Colombo Art Biennale and at a
solo show at the Fairway Galle Literary Festival to name a few. She has lectured at
several British art colleges and having worked with clients such as Yves St Laurent,
Calvin Klein, John Paul Gautier, Pierre Cardin and Ralph Lauren, her designs have been
featured in several international publications including British Vogue. Her paintings
invite multiple interpretations and reflect man’s existential anxieties, the human
condition and the state of the planet. Her collection at Art Connect was a multimedia
trilingual exhibition on climate change, sustainability, inclusivity and reconciliation.
""While it has always informed each other, it is ever more the case that Art and Fashion
are closely linked. Artists walk catwalks, as did BRIT bad girl artist Tracey Emin;
Japan's great hot artist Kusama Yayoi designed for Marc Jacobs, and Jeff Koons the
American artist, has this season designed Louis Vuitton bags with iconic images from
Leonardo Da Vinci and Vincent Van Gogh. Art is of course a pure form of expression in that
it serves no purpose whatsoever, except itself, and the nurturing of the soul. In contrast
Fashion is applied Art designed specifically with a market in mind. But they are
intrinsically connected within the domain of creativity. Art can be used in fashion and
informs fashion and good innovative fashion design truly is a vital and accessible
expression of art"" TEXT by Tina Edward Gunawardhana and Panchali Illankoon PHOTOGRAPHS by

May 03 2017. Every month I have the fabulous task of compiling a best dressed list, I
attend some fabulous events, sort through hundreds of photos from the past month to find
the best of the best. I do a roundup of events that played host to some of the most
sartorially savvy, polished, eclectic, and stylish of dressers. April - the month of
endless holidays and unbearable heat still played host to some great events, like the
Fawlty Towers dinner at the Mount Lavinia Hotel, which was hilariously entertaining! All
out glamour seemed to be on trend for March while April's looks were a bit more subdued
and heat combative! The people on my list impressed with their style, their poise, their
ability to pull a unique look together and were the most soigne of the soigne for the
month. These style mavens know how to turn heads. There was no shortage of fashion hits
from this most fashionable month and I look forward to seeing how our city’s sartorially
savvy bring more stylish looks in May. Bangladesh National Day Ashok never seems to try
too hard after all, being stylish is like being funny: it doesn’t work if you force it. I
like that he’s aware of the fact that if your suit shouts, your tie should whisper (the
grey and powder blue combo is always sartorial magic) managing to be both smart and
rakish! Prof JB (below right) Business battledress worn with panache, no one looks more
comfortable in their sartorial skin and proves you can grow older without sacrificing your
sense of style. Fawlty Towers at the Mount Lavinia Hotel Ramona (left) and Gish (right)
True style is finding a look and making it your own which Gish always manages to do. His
style is a lot like his personality - mannered, elegant, charming, considered and cool. He
has a style that manages to be both traditional and unique! Cobalt blue and orange have
always made for a fantastic colour pairing and Ramona makes the case in point in this
great dress, paired with the on trend sandal silhouette, she looks fab! Annette's simple
sheath silhouette with leg lengthening nude stilettos is a lovely way to work this
fabulous colour! Teal Appeal Celine Dion Jada Pinkett Smith Victoria Beckham One of the
hottest colours for 2016, championed by Gucci's teal popularity shows no sign of slowing
down in 2017. Beloved by celebs, this colour works on pretty much every skin tone, adding
to its universal appeal. SAARC International Women's Day Spring florals have never looked
prettier, the enchanting pattern on her sari, the flower in her hair and pop of red
lipstick all work to make a stellar look. The Principle Of It by Goolbai Gunasekera
Between the expert draping, the high neckline and the simple gold border on an off white
sari, this ensemble is a home run! Womens Empowerment Group Head-to-toe black or navy can
make for an eye-catching outfit, provided you go for pieces with interesting details. Her
cropped hair and cropped jumpsuit are fashion forward, interesting and empowering! Sleek,
minimalist with a hint of girlish charm, Catherine looks lovely in this off the shoulder
monochromatic ensemble. Lauren Santo Domingo Olivia Palermo In 2015, Columbian designer
Johanna Ortiz brought this original off the shoulder silhouette to the forefront of
fashion collective conciousness with an elastic off-the-shoulder neckline and full,
gathered balloon sleeves that sit low on the arm, spinning off the take that exposed
shoulders are a playful, sexy antidote to minimalism. It’s a look that appeals to girls of
every taste: Whether your style is classic, romantic, or thrift-store bohemian, an off-
the-shoulder blouse can go from day to night; leaves plenty of room for accessorizing,
especially with earrings; and offers a skin-baring option for girls who prefer not to
expose their arms or décolletage. HE Elizabeth Sophie Tartan has always been cool,

life_fashion90_1_ALEAF_A_sustainable_fashion_brand.pdf,"ALEAF: A sustainable fashion brand
Jul 22 2022. ALEAF, a sustainable fashion brand by Alafiya Najmudeen was born out of a
desire to create products from earth-friendly materials that were sourced responsibly.
Aiming to be a brand that is more than a smattering of buzzwords, ALEAF hopes to embody
the ethics they believe in. Founder and CEO Alafiya thus embarked on a journey to “build a
brand that creates a space to make guilt-free fashion choices that help the planet and its
habitants without compromising on quality, luxury or elegance”. Alafiya also hopes to
“help uplift communities in Sri Lanka and eventually around the world by creating jobs and
donating 30% of its profits to the Foundation of Goodness to uplift and empower
underprivileged communities in Sri Lanka”. Pictured: Alafiya Najmudeen “Growing up I
watched my father succeed as an entrepreneur and always dreamed about becoming an
entrepreneur like him one day” Alafiya shared. “My parents also taught me from a very
young age that it was important to be kind and to give back to those in need. This has
always stuck with me and one day I wanted to really help make a change for the rural
people of my country. Graduating from La Trobe University with a Bachelor of Business
majoring in Events and Sports Management, I knew that I wanted to do something in the
creative field because I loved making things and organising events. I was always doodling
all over my books or brainstorming my next idea.” Alafiya spoke to the Daily Mirror Life
about her brand, how she’s trying to make a difference, her plans for the future, and
more. Q How did the name for the product come about? The name is combination of 3 elements
that are a reflection of the Brand and Founder: The brand name is a part of my name It is
the first letter of the Arabic alphabet - a representation of my culture A representation
of the materials we use as they are all-natural and made from plants Q Tell us about the
brand. How and why was ALEAF born? As I lost my job due to COVID 19, I started thinking
about what was next for me. A fashion lover and an altruist, I decided to combine two
things that I was really passionate about and decided to fulfill my dream of becoming an
entrepreneur. As I began reading up on the fashion industry, I realised that I wanted
ALEAF to be a part of the change that the industry needed. I wanted ALEAF to create a
happier, cleaner, and fairer world. As I now had my vision in place, I embarked on my
journey of finding the materials that would best reflect my brand. Coming from a tropical
island, the materials I chose really felt close to home and they also had a more positive
impact on the environment and the people who make them. ALEAF is a representation of all
of the beauty and adventure that our island stands for. The brand was founded on my desire
to start by giving back to those in need in Sri Lanka and hopefully one day I would be
able to give back to those in need around the world. Q How are ALEAF bags made? Our bags
are designed to be timeless, sophisticated, multi-functional, and inclusive. All of our
bags are designed as part of a collection and they are for everyone (Women, Men, and
Unisex). Each collection is created to tell its story and all of the bags will reflect
this story. We choose the colours based on the feeling the collection is supposed to
invoke in you. This is why for the first collection EMPOWER, we chose the colours green,
navy blue, charcoal, mulberry, and pebble. Each of these colours was a representation of
boldness, confidence, and sophistication. Once the bags have been designed and the
materials and trims have been chosen we work with our makers to create a prototype. Once
the prototype has been approved we go on to produce our bags. We take great care in making
each of these bags as we want our customers to have a bag of exceptional quality that
showcases the talents of our artisans. Q What are the materials you’re using to create the
bags? Innovative and sustainable bio-based materials called Piñatex and DESSERTO are two
of the materials we currently use. Piñatex is an innovative, natural, and cruelty-free
textile made of fibre from the waste leaves of the pineapple plant. These leaves are a by-
product of the existing pineapple industry and therefore require no additional resourcesto produce. It also creates additional income for the farmers as these leaves would
otherwise be burned. DESSERTO is the world’s first highly sustainable and environmentally
friendly organic material made of Nopal Cactus, also known as the prickly pear. The mature
leaves are carefully selected without causing any harm to the plant itself. The leaves are
then dried in the sun for three days after which the organic raw material is used as part
of the patented formula to create DESSERTO. Q What are the products/ types of bags
currently available? Our first collection, EMPOWER comprises 4 products: Amor Laptop
Sleeve (Large and Regular) Amari Pouch Rayyan Messenger Bag Aya Slim Tote These products
were inspired as we were transitioning from being at home due to COVID-19 and getting back
to what was the new normal. We wanted the products to make the journey fun and convenient.
We believe that having the right bag can really make a statement and make life a lot
easier because you have everything you need handy. Q What were the challenges faced when
designing and creating these products? One of the biggest challenges when creating the
designs was figuring out how to minimise waste, and make them multi-functional and
inclusive. The biggest challenge in creating these products was that when ALEAF first
started we wanted all of the products to be manufactured in Sri Lanka. However, as the
situation of the country worsened a lot of the skilled labour which was already extremely
hard to find became even harder as people migrated overseas. This has forced us to have to
look in a different direction. Additionally, the materials that we use to create our bags
are very new and are different from making genuine leather or synthetic leather bags. Q
How are you using ALEAF to uplift communities? ALEAF promises to donate 30% of all profits
annually to the Foundation of Goodness to help uplift and empower rural communities in Sri
Lanka by providing them with basic necessities, access to education and employment. I also
aim to work with small businesses in Sri Lanka wherever it is possible from packaging to
manufacturing. I am also a mentor of the Women’s Empowerment department at the Foundation
of Goodness where I work closely with the team to help women who have completed a course
or several courses from the Foundation of Goodness transition into employment or start
their own business. Q “Sustainable materials”, “slow fashion”, “ethical production”,
“responsible packaging” are often simply lofty buzzwords thrown around by brands. How are
you ensuring your brand is embodying everything you say you stand for? We ensure that we
embody everything the brand stands for by being transparent about our operations from
start to finish. We want our customers to be able to know what they are buying, who made
their products, what goes into the products, how to care for their products to extend
their life, and also how they can responsibly recycle their products at the end of its
lifecycle. We choose materials that we believe have a holistic impact on the planet and
its people. We use materials that are not only environmentally friendly and cruelty-free
but are also durable because we want our products to last long. Whilst the materials we
use are not perfect and do still consist of a percentage of Polyurethane (aka PU), most of
our materials are partially biodegradable and are made responsibly. The materials use eco-
friendly dyes to obtain colours that are not toxic and use minimal water and electricity
to produce. Most of these materials are made from waste that would otherwise be burned
which would create significant carbon emissions whilst also creating an additional income
stream for farmers. At ALEAF, we aim to reduce waste and keep true to our promise of a
slow fashion brand by producing only 10 pieces per colour of each product. If we feel that
there is a demand for our products we then make an additional 5-10 pieces in total still
leaving the number of products made below 50. We are all about uplifting and empowering
our people and therefore we ensure that all of our makers are fairly compensated for their
work. We only work with small teams because this allows us the ability to foster close
relationships. We visit our makers to ensure that they work in safe conditions, are
treated fairly, and invest in tools and equipment that they may need to carry out their
work safely and efficiently. We accept that we are not perfect and with every new daycomes an opportunity to learn and get better. We will continue to keep learning and keep
improving our practices to create a cleaner and fairer world. Q What’s next for the brand?
As we re-launch our brand after a 3-month hiatus we hope to come back stronger and better.
We will be re-launching with our first collection EMPOWER and are currently working on our
second collection and hope to share it with the world in July/August. This collection will
be called Liberty as it aims to foster a feeling of being free. We are relocating and
setting up in Melbourne, Australia where we really hope that this will help us make a
bigger impact. Q Are your products only available via your website? No, our products are
available online and at The Design Collective in Sri Lanka. However, we only have a
selected few designs available at The Design Collective. All customised purchases are only
available on our website. Pix Courtesy: ALEAF Rihaab Mowlana is the Deputy Features Editor

life_fashion90_1_CFW_2019_-_Day_3.pdf,"CFW 2019 - Day 3
Mar 01 2019. Colour and glamour dominated the runway last evening on day 3 of HSBC Colombo
Fashion Week. Held in the ballroom of the Shangri-La, Colombo, the opulent setting
provided a perfect backdrop to showcase an array of elegant designs which commanded
attention as they made their debut on the runway. Aslam Hussein, Sharmilla Ruberu, Annika
Fernando, Kamil Hewavitharana, Vathsala Gunasekara, and SuketDhir presented exquisite
collections with an unforgettable wow factor! Here is what Ajai Vir Singh (Founder and
President) and Fazeena Rajabdeen (Shared CEO and Director) had to say. Day 3 advanced a
step further from Galle Face when we moved to Shangri-La with the designers showing great
design character from the start to the finale. It’s getting better and better. Day 3
showcased to a packed house at Shangri-La. Designers showcased strong silhouettes with
structure and form. Contemporary favourites like Meraki, Maus and Vathsala presented
strong collections along with Aslam, Kamil and SukethDhir. Aslam Hussein Sticking
religiously to his style oeuvre of creating couture clothes, in this collection Aslam
interspersed prints in a pastel pink with sparkling silver, and glittering gold fabrics to
create designs in his signature style. Titled Heavenly Rhapsody this collection featured
heavily embellished fabric which was used to create a mix of beautifully ornamental gowns
and separates. The combination of rich fabric and structured silhouettes conveyed his
expression of impression via his creations. As the name of his collection suggests it was
indeed heavenly. Sharmila Ruberu This collection was undeniably all about sleeves. From
trumpet and dolman sleeves to bishop and choirboy sleeves, designer Sharmilla unleashed
the full gamut of statement sleeves in this collection. Inspired by Picasso, Sharmilla had
picked elements from the great artist and presented her own take on it. Her colour palette
was dark in the main but clever use of mustard and russet along with pops of colourful
stripes added nuances of sleekness. Her silhouettes were simple but her sleeves added just
the right amount of drama to each piece. Full marks to her for taking the plunge and
embarking on a fashionable adventure which put sleeves very firmly in the fashion
spotlight. Annika Fernando Living up to her reputation of the Miss Cool of Sri Lankan
fashion, Annika Fernando presented a collection that contained notes of her signature
style - simplistic sophistication. Her brand Maus is revered for its clean cuts with
nuances of chic. Using the colours of chambray, black and white, her silhouettes were
conservative in the main with hints of dare in the form of cold-shouldered tops. Sleek
looks ensured her collection looked effortlessly chic. We liked her pie crust collars too.
Her accessories of bags and sandals complemented the collection just so perfectly. Kamil
Hewavitharana Adding drama to the runway Kamil unleashed his creativity with an entire
collection of outfits that made a fashionable statement. Sticking to the sophisticated
fashion colour of black with subtle tones of ochre and orange, he accentuated it with two
dimensional geometric shapes and stained glass patterns which he created on the fabric.
The fashion dramatist that he is, Kamil presented form fitting outfits with voluminous
sleeves and necklines slashed to the waist which added a frisson of excitement to his
collection. Vathsala Gunasekera Floral blooms hit the runway when Vathsala sent model
after model clad in big floral prints. Having designed her own fabric for this collection
her silhouettes featured drop crotch pants , prairie skirts, dresses and kimono style tops
which all featured statement sleeves which are very much in trend. Vathsala has a knack
for creating youthful silhouettes. She has managed to create an impactful sense of
balance, mixing modern and quirky which will appease the younger fashion savvy dresser. An
indo-centric brand, that combines artisanal techniques with luxe fabrics, SuketDhir was
the recipient of the International Woolmark Prize in 2016. A proponent of old school
tailoring this collection showcased his master craftsmanship to full effect. Khadi fabrics
with dainty prints graduated to a conservative colour palette for the men in stylishdesigns while his womenswear collection saw greater use of colour. Japanese inspired
prints in tasteful colours were used to create a range of separates and dresses which
looked very sleek and chic. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

life_fashion90_1_CFW_Taking_Fashion_Forward_Powered_for_the_next_20_by_the_la.pdf,"CFW Taking Fashion Forward: Powered for the next 20 by the last 20 years
Mar 20 2023. A deeply spiritual being, Ajai Vir Singh is one who does not embark on a
venture lightly. His vision to elevate Sri Lanka’s standing in the global fashion arena is
driven by his relentless passion not only for fashion but also as a payback to the country
he now considers his home. Twenty years ago, Ajai presented the first edition of Colombo
Fashion Week albeit then called Colombo Fashion Weekend. Since then, like a butterfly
emerging from a chrysalis, CFW has undergone a metamorphosis and has emerged as a well-
respected and renowned platform for Sri Lankan designers to showcase their collections.
With days to go before the presentation of this season’s shows, Ajai and Fazeena, the
hands-on CEO of Colombo Fashion Week, took time to reflect on their past and also speak
about their plans for the future of CFW. Q When the notion of starting a fashion week in
Sri Lanka back in 2003 came to your mind what vision did you have? To be honest at that
time it was “Just a Try”, more than anything else, an attempt with a question ‘Can this be
done here?’ Can fashion be revived? Can the next generation be inspired to follow fashion?
That was how it started. Q What do you think sets Colombo Fashion Week apart from other
international fashion weeks in the South Asian region? CFW is a development platform,
unlike other fashion weeks. It is completely invested in identifying new designers working
with them providing resources, guidance and mentoring and then moving to presenting and
promoting. A lot of knowledge infusion takes place on the platform. Secondly, it’s a
hybrid format created during the last 20 years to suit Sri Lanka. It was effective for Sri
Lanka, and over the years this format of presentation is being followed in India, Pakistan
and Bangladesh too. When we started I knew the traditional fashion week system won’t work
hence we had created a new one based on market conditions. Q Tell us how fashion’s
sustainability credentials in the Sri Lankan context have evolved since two decades ago?
Over the last five years, my conviction has only grown stronger that Sri Lankan designers
can take the lead in South Asia by being the most sustainable. This can be our edge. We at
CFW have created two important initiatives to push that. A thought leadership platform
called the Responsible Fashion Summit, and secondly a garment evaluation tool called
Responsible Meter, which scores garments on a ten-point scoring system. This standard is
one of its kind in the world. These kinds of initiatives equip and gear Sri Lankan
designers to actively pursue the sustainability path. It keeps them empowered and creates
a sustainable identity for the industry. This also synergises with the apparel industry
too. Q What initiatives at CFW do you run to ensure Sri Lanka keeps nurturing cutting-edge
designer talent? There are numerous initiatives. Emerging Designer Initiatives are our key
focus, as they feed the fashion design industry. When we started, there was Yoland, others
that you see on the platform were new, hence the new that you see today will be hopefully
the known ones of tomorrow. I have personally seen all their journeys star. I remember
their first meetings and where we met, to me that is a great encouragement for the
platform. For the last 7-8 years Fazeena has been driving the Emerging Designer
development with her team and you see the results of that. We started with CFW Day at Unis
and design schools, followed by Project 7 (design development system)and then CFW
Accelerate. This is the most comprehensive development programme especially in these tough
times, supported by HSBC. Ideation, Collection planning, Presentation and Retail Exposure
are where the focus is. We keep evolving the resource structure so new designers have the
required support to excel. Q What have been some of the highlights of the last twenty
years? There are so many highlights on this journey. This project of development has been
a forerunner and there has been a constant learning process on the run. One of the key
highlights would be that we were able to build pride in Sri Lankan fashion, making it a
talking point for the fashion consumers here. This was not the case when we started. This
to me was very important. This gave hope to the new generation to enter this creativeindustry. We knew it was a nascent industry and a lot of loose ends needed tightening and
structure needed to be created, to foster the above. Today more than 80% of designers we
see are products of the CFW design development system. Another highlight is that an eco-
system for fashion has been created. The younger generation can hope to start their
labels, and thinking of fashion at not difficult. Education, Retail, Designer development,
Awareness of trends, Marketing, Show Presentation, Promotions, Collaborations etc are in
place now. Q To mark the 20th anniversary of CFW what are you hoping the designers will
bring to the show? Hoping to present the best of Sri Lankan fashion even in these
interesting times, with the hope that things will only improve and a better environment is
provided for creative industries. That design entrepreneurship will increase, and the
brain drain will reverse. Even though it seems like a tall order, it's still quite
achievable. Often found working hard behind the scenes, Fazeena is the gel that binds the
organisation together. Starting at the bottom of the ladder, and learning the ropes,
Fazeena is now CEO of CFW. She credits this rise to her commitment and passion for the
vision of CFW which keeps the torch burning for her. With her hands-on approach and no-
nonsense attitude to work, Fazeena’s pet project is nurturing and guiding emerging
designers under Ajai’s watchful gaze. Q Within CFW your pet project is the emerging
designer segment. How would you rate its success? I see it as the engine that keeps the
fashion design industry moving with the continuous emergence of new talent. From just a
few designers entering the fashion space yearly to a platform that nurtures and funds new
talent every year, I think it’s come a long way. The Emerging Designer Accelerate
Programme is a multi-pronged mentorship platform along with funding support. It certainly
has minimised the time it takes a young designer to enter the market and retail. Q What
areas within the Sri Lankan fashion ecosystem need further development and what part does
CFW hope to play in that? The responsible fashion aspect is a space that requires
continuous improvement and knowledge. At CFW this is one of our core pillars and we have
been leading the way for the fashion industry in SL to include this in their design
thinking and development process. We have developed cutting-edge tools such as the
responsible meter in this regard. We hope to bring in thought leadership in the subject
matter and develop new ideas via technology to enhance such practices. Q How do you and
Ajai keep ensuring that the show stays relevant each season? We have adopted a progressive
vision and a commitment to the industry to move in a certain direction. Despite a civil
war, a pandemic and an economic crisis this is one platform that has continued to deliver.
Q What do you say to critics who say that CFW has run its course? Twenty years later, here
we are .., with an industry and a brand that continues to grow despite the circumstances.
That should speak for itself Q Where do you see CFW in the next 5 years? Creating commerce
internationally for designers, and formulating exciting new verticals for the
organisation! Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_1_Designer_1-2-1_Manoji_Lekamlage.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Manoji Lekamlage
Feb 01 2021. Realising a long-held ambition to become a fashion designer, Manoji Lekamlage
launched her label Mash96 in the middle of 2018. A graduate of AOD, Manoji went one step
further and acquired a Diploma in Pattern Making and Batik Dyeing for exports at the Sri
Lanka Institute of Textile & Apparel (SLITA). What sparked your interest in fashion
design? Ever since I was a little girl I loved fashion. I have always had a passion for
fashion designing. I have always loved new trends and loved to see fashion magazines. I
have artistic inclinations whether it be playing with patterns or dressing uniquely. For
me, fashion is a form of art and is my form of creative expression. What made you take
fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Choosing my career meant doing what I
love and what I am passionate about. I chose fashion designing as my career as there are
many levels of opportunities available and that meant I could create my own path. How has
your work evolved since you began your own label? Initially, I focused on casual women’s
wear, starting the first collection with appliqués made on plain linen and viscose
fabrics. It has now evolved to bridal and custom made designs. We have also launched our
latest batik premium collection. Where do you look for creative inspirations? I love
observing people’s day to day lifestyles in different countries, and how they adapt to
seasons. I get inspiration from my travels, fashion magazines and of course, Pinterest!
Describe your latest collection? Our latest collection was made out of batik textiles. I
actually started batik especially since it’s a handmade textile and we need to give it
value as Sri Lankan designers. We need to uplift these textiles for them to do well in
domestic as well as foreign markets. All of my collections are affordable and trendy. I
want to give my customers exclusive designs, therefore we only make a limited number of
pieces per collection. Uniqueness means quality and not quantity. Who is your muse? I
don’t have a specific muse. I just draw whatever comes to my mind after I am inspired by a
fashion runaway, magazines or movies. But as a person, Stephanie Abu-Sbeiha is one of my
favourite characters. I love her sense of fashion and personality. What are your
sustainability credentials? Zero-waste, quality over quantity, and making the best out of
resources. What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work?
Technology fascinates me, the human mind, body and soul. The internet is a vast source of
opportunities, possibilities and ideas. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned
since you started your company? Hard work pays off. The more I focused on something the
more effort I put into it, the better it gets. As a creative entrepreneur, I always love
to experiment and to learn new things, there’s no shortage of lessons to be learned. By
learning small things and doing experiments we can make our own path. Lessons make you a
better person! What is your motto? “Made with love” What is your favourite part about
being a designer? I always love what I do! The favourite part of been a designer is to get
paid for the creative output and that every day is different. It is incredibly rewarding
seeing people interact and experience my work. Finding inspiration anywhere. How do you
want women to feel when wearing your clothes? Women choose outfits according to how they
feel or want to feel. I want them to feel confident, comfortable and outstanding in my
clothes. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

Aug 10 2021. Launching her eponymous brand in 2015 designer Nayani Fernando has been on an
exciting journey in fashion. She focuses on sustainability and designs clothes that appeal
to modern fashionable women. A keen observer, Nayani is inspired by those around her and
how they dress and style themselves. What sparked your interest in fashion design? When I
was younger my mother used to sew clothes for me and my sisters from scratch. I remember
being very interested in the process and would watch her sew, igniting my interest in
fashion design from an early age. I’ve always enjoyed dressing my friends and sisters and
helping them pair outfits and colours together. Over the years I’ve enjoyed observing how
other people coordinate their own unique sense of style and have tried to take inspiration
from this. What made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? I am
beyond grateful to have very supportive parents that believe in me and helped me identify
my own talents. I always knew I wanted to work in the garment industry and couldn’t
picture myself thriving in any other field. Are you self-taught or did you study fashion
design? A mix of both. I studied design at the University of Salford, Manchester but have
experimented with my own techniques and methods over the years. How has your work evolved
since you began your own label? I always believe in changing my brand motifs with the
times whilst trying not to deviate too much from my core identity and aesthetic. My focus
has always been to make beautiful clothes but with different tones and accents depending
on the season. Ensuring my garments continue to be functional, wearable and durable is
very important to me. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? No. I
don’t want to limit myself. I still have so many aspects of design I would like to
explore. The possibilities are limitless. Where do you look for creative inspiration? I
find myself being inspired by art or occasionally photography, it doesn’t have to be a
specific medium. I usually start with colours or patterns and then take it from there.
Describe your latest collection? I want to create a collection that virtually transports
you to a tropical destination. The silhouettes are airy and comfortable and exude grace
and functionality. Who is your muse? Every season it changes. That being said a constant
style icon and muse for me personally has been Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, she’s the epitome
of a NAYANI woman. What are your sustainability credentials? I currently practice
sustainability in many ways, for instance socially and environmentally. I have always
believed in fair trade pay for the women and men that help create and make our garments.
We are currently in the process of putting together a zero-waste programme that benefits
our planet and protects our environment. Additionally, we recently launched a collection
with organic linen and hope to use more eco-friendly fabrics in the future. What are you
fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? I am currently following
a lot of Alabama Chanin’s work. It's fascinating to read about the years she’s devoted and
dedicated to creating a sustainable fashion community. It’s my aim and goal to make NAYANI
a 100% sustainable brand in the future. I understand the process is a tedious one but I am
determined to get there. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you
started your company? Never forget your brand identity and what it stands for. What’s your
motto Stay true to yourself and do it with love and gusto. Which international or local
designers are you inspired by? There are so many amazing fashion labels and designers
nowadays but The Row, Maison Margiela and Celine are a few. What role do you think social
media plays in fashion today? Social media has given creatives the opportunity to have a
personal relationship with customers. Instagram for instance is a visual storytelling
application that helps you convey the entire concept of your brand/collection through
images and captions. I feel as social media users we are so aware of the impacts of
fashion and the importance of being a sustainable brand as well. It not only helps us
connect locally but also internationally. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalistspecialising in travel, fashion, lifestyle, cuisine and personalities. She is also the

life_fashion90_1_Fashionmarketlk_The_Must-know_Global_Fashion_Success_Story_f.pdf,"Fashionmarket.lk: The Must-know Global Fashion Success Story from Sri Lanka
Jan 30 2018. In 2015 when Fashionmarket .lk entered the wearables scene in Sri Lanka, it
was a complete novelty to discover a broad curation of designer wear by some of the
country’s best-known designers and brands next to new labels and emerging talent. Within a
short span of two years, this unusual retailer has managed to charge to the forefront of
Lankan fashion as a pioneer due to its product offering consisting of locally designed and
made fashion with an international appeal and unique design-centric styling. In terms of
operation too Fashionmarket .lk was an innovator considering Sri Lanka is a market where
only a few fashion brands use e-commerce and next to zero of them go exclusively digital.
However, influenced by trailblazers like Fashionmarket .lk, Sri Lanka’s e-commerce market
which is currently estimated at around 40 million dollars, is predicted to grow tenfold to
400 million dollars by 2021/22. The best kept secret in fashion e-tail What really made
Fashionmarket .lk stand out in the consumer psyche was its signature east-meets-west style
of a fresh tropical chic aesthetic rooted in Sri Lanka, and its focus on delivering
consumers the confidence to be their real selves through clothing that resonated with
their identities, cultures and values. Fashionmarket .lk founder Linda Speldewinde stated
that “Fashion available to the modern woman needs to reflect herself, her beliefs, work
and life. This thinking is what drives Fashionmarket .lk with the kind of fashion that
enhances women in their diverse roles as professionals and everyday heroines, encouraging
them to dress their best and do their best in life.” This philosophy hit home with
consumers worldwide allowing Fashionmarket .lk to grow beyond Sri Lanka to become a
beloved online style portal in over twenty countries including USA, India, Canada,
Singapore, UAE, Australia and Malaysia. Fashionmarket .lk soon presented its own resident
brands with a range of affordable designer fashion such as chic tops, pants and dresses
and even beachwear that encouraged holiday shopping in Sri Lanka. This resident brand
portfolio also included ‘Urban Drape’ designer sarees that soared in popularity due to the
modern take on batik and handloom in cotton. “Beautiful design, product and ethos!” one
architect echoed her impression on Fashionmarket .lk while a professional in personality
development stated that she was “Enthralled by the comments on how beautiful the saree
was...they have never seen such creativity in one piece. It made me feel proud to
represent such a rich heritage”. With its obvious appeal, Fashionmarket .lk seems to be
one of the best kept secrets in fashion e-commerce bearing enormous potential to become a
global voice in style. An all new experience in fashion Fashionmarket .lk’s core products
are design-centric, customer-focused wearables, the Chief Executive Officer of
Fashionmarket .lk, Harshi Alexander mentioned; “Understanding the modern woman inside out,
we know that design and variety are essential. This is why we collaborate with young
brands and fashion colleges like AOD that can connect talented designers to us, and why we
focus on nurturing a product offering that spans from exquisite investment pieces to
everyday wear.” However, it’s much bigger than the product itself. Fashionmarket .lk
treats fashion as an experience, and aims to deliver an altogether new take on it with
everything they do. The ‘#SheInspires’ campaign, the style identity of 2017 Ms. Universe
Sri Lanka—who is the face of the brand—and facilitating worldwide ‘shop the runway’ as the
retail partner for Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka were all new fashion experiences
by Fashionmarket .lk. In the near future, Fashionmarket .lk will offer yet another novel
fashion experience by crossing the boundaries between the physical and the digital realms
to present an unusual concept store with bag-free shopping. This will combine the best of
both worlds with the touch-and-feel intimacy of traditional retail fused with the
weightless convenience of e-commerce to give a unique experience of shopping at a
stunningly curated store, and having your purchases delivered to your doorstep. This
Fashionmarket .lk concept store will be the first of its kind in Sri Lanka. Presenting aglobal fashion story The Managing Director of Fashionmarket .lk, Lin Gong-Deutschmann
explains that the brand is working on bringing in even more novelty to the consumer; “We
have plans to approach our product in terms of women's wider needs which means there will
be major growth in our portfolio to give our shoppers the ability to meet all their
lifestyle needs on Fashionmarket .lk. We’re also thinking of exciting new collaborations
with fellow Sri Lankan curators and strong regional partners in India, US and the
Southeast Asian countries.” Fashionmarket .lk has also recently announced an end of season
sale, which will bring about price slashes on its designer pieces from 29th January to
02nd, 2018, available for worldwide shipping. Fashionmarket .lk speaks to the new woman,
appealing to her aspirations and dreams of living a full life and being her true self,
through fashion and style that brings out her very best. Discover the end of season sale

many things done by models to maintain their flawless skin! Use A Good Moisturizer -

smooth and clean. A recommended moisturizer made for Sri Lankan skin and climate is Ponds
BB+. A moisturizing cream, it primes the skin creating a sheer coat that protects the skin
from sun damage and other harmful factors to the skin. Play The Look - Once a neutral
makeup look is done, don’t be afraid to play it up! Getting the model look is all about

life_fashion90_1_Kess_Seeing_the_hair_and_beauty_agenda_at_MBFW_Sri_Lanka.pdf,"Kess: Seeing the hair and beauty agenda at MBFW Sri Lanka
Oct 29 2024. The much vaunted Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka is days away and this
year too leading hair salon Kess will collaborate with the designers to create cutting
edge hair and beauty looks to grace the runway. Vasantha de Silva the founder of Kess and
his partner Prabath Gamage reveal the preparation and inspiration that goes on to deliver
a stellar performance behind the scenes during the show. Q Kess has been a go-to salon in
Colombo for over 25 years. What has been the key to maintaining such a strong presence in
the beauty industry over this time? The key to Kess Salon's longevity and influence lies
in our unwavering commitment to quality, consistency, and innovation. Over the years,
we’ve built trust with our clients by offering personalized services, staying up-to-date
with global beauty trends, and investing in continuous training for our team. We also
prioritize creating a welcoming environment where every client feels valued. Our ability
to adapt to the evolving needs of the industry—whether through new techniques, products,
or technologies—has ensured that we remain relevant and continue to grow. Ultimately, our
passion for beauty and dedication to customer satisfaction has been the foundation of our
lasting presence in Colombo’s beauty landscape. Q How has Kess Salon evolved over the
years to cater to the ever-changing trends in fashion and beauty? What keeps you ahead of
the curve? What keeps us ahead of the curve is our focus on personalization. We understand
that beauty is not one-size-fits-all, and we take pride in offering tailored solutions
that enhance the individuality of every client. Moreover, we leverage social media and
data insights to anticipate emerging trends, ensuring our clients are always a step ahead
in the beauty game. At Kess, it’s all about blending creativity with expertise to deliver
not just services, but exceptional experiences. Q This year, Kess is partnering with MBFW
Sri Lanka once again. What inspires your team when creating innovative looks for such a
high-profile event? We draw inspiration from the dynamic energy of fashion itself – the
fusion of global trends with Sri Lanka’s unique cultural essence. For MBFW, our focus is
on creating looks that celebrate individuality, empower confidence, and push creative
boundaries. Each style we develop reflects the artistry and innovation that defines our
brand, ensuring that every model not only complements the designer’s vision but also
stands out on the runway. Q How do you approach collaborating with designers and design
graduates for a show like MBFW? How do you ensure that the hair and makeup complement
their unique visions? We collaborate with the AOD creative team to study the portfolios of
all designers and design graduates. A show like MBFW is all about synergy and
communication. Our process begins by understanding each designer's collection concept,
colour palette, mood, and key inspirations. This helps us align our hair and makeup vision
with theirs. Our goal is to enhance, not overpower, their work. The right hair and makeup
serve to complement the garments, ensuring the entire presentation feels cohesive and
memorable on the runway. Q MBFW Sri Lanka is a significant event with many challenges. How
does Kess plan to manage the scale of the show, and what specific challenges are you
preparing for? Managing the scale of MBFW is no small feat—it’s a high-pressure
environment with countless moving parts. However, with over 30 years of experience, the
Kess team thrives under this kind of pressure. It’s the excitement and adrenaline of
events like this that drive us. Our extensive experience allows us to anticipate and
prepare for on-the-day challenges, ensuring we stay agile and responsive. For us, it’s not
just about managing the pressure but embracing it, and that’s what sets us apart. Q
Creating looks for multiple designers can be demanding. How do you stay creative and
ensure each look remains unique while working within tight timelines? Staying creative
under pressure requires a mix of preparation and spontaneity. I start by thoroughly
understanding each designer’s vision and brand identity, which helps me tailor ideas that
align with their style. To keep things fresh, I draw inspiration from a variety ofsources—art, nature, culture, and even everyday moments. Mood boards and brainstorming
sessions allow me to explore different directions quickly. Q Kess is known for setting
trends in Colombo’s beauty scene. What trends do you foresee making an impact during this
year’s MBFW, and how do you plan to incorporate them into your work? We are always attuned
to global beauty movements and tailor them to resonate with local preferences. For this
year’s MBFW, we anticipate a strong focus on natural, glowing skin, bold yet wearable
makeup looks, and innovative hair textures that embrace individuality. Sustainable beauty
is also becoming a defining trend, with eco-friendly products and techniques gaining
prominence. We aim to inspire attendees by blending high-fashion aesthetics with everyday
beauty solutions, ensuring Kess continues to set the standard for Colombo’s evolving
beauty scene. Q MBFW also highlights design graduates. How important is it for Kess to
work with emerging talent, and what advice would you offer young creatives entering the
industry? At Kess, we believe that nurturing new talent is crucial for the future of the
fashion industry. Working with emerging designers not only brings fresh perspectives and
innovative ideas to our brand but also helps to create a supportive ecosystem where
creativity can flourish. Young creatives have the potential to push boundaries and
challenge conventions, which is essential for growth in fashion. For those entering the
industry, my advice is to stay authentic and passionate about your vision. Embrace
collaboration, seek mentorship, and be open to feedback. Build a strong network and never
underestimate the power of perseverance. Remember, every experience, whether good or bad,
is a stepping stone toward your success. Q Every salon has its signature touch. What
defines Kess Salon’s approach to hair and beauty, and how do you maintain that signature
across such a variety of events? At Kess, our approach to hair and beauty is defined by a
commitment to personalized service and high-quality products. We believe that every client
deserves an experience tailored to their unique style and needs, which is why we invest
time in understanding their preferences during consultations. To maintain our signature
style across various events, we focus on our core values: creativity, excellence, and
client satisfaction. Our team undergoes regular training to stay updated on the latest
trends and techniques, ensuring that we consistently deliver exceptional results,
regardless of the occasion. We also encourage open communication with our clients
throughout the process, allowing us to adapt and refine our services to match their
vision. This flexibility, combined with our dedication to quality, allows Kess Salon to
shine at every event. Q As a salon that has been an institution for decades, where do you
see Kess heading in the future? Are there any new initiatives or expansions on the
horizon? As a salon that has proudly served our community for decades, we are excited to
share some of our upcoming initiatives. One of the most thrilling developments is the
launch of the Kess Academy, which will soon provide a platform for aspiring stylists to
enhance their skills and creativity. Alongside this, we are thrilled to announce the Kess
Masterclass, led by our ever-in-demand founder, Vasantha de Silva. His expertise and
vision will undoubtedly inspire both new and seasoned professionals in the industry. These
initiatives reflect our commitment to nurturing talent and staying at the forefront of
beauty and wellness trends. We are continually looking to expand our offerings and
innovate, ensuring that Kess remains a leader in the salon industry for years to come. Pix

life_fashion90_1_MBFW_Day_1_-_Graduate_Showcase.pdf,"MBFW Day 1 - Graduate Showcase
Oct 26 2018. Day one of Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka kicked off in style as 33
uber talented fashion graduates took to the runway to showcase their collections.
Innovative, and fashion savvy the collections displayed the wealth of design talent that
Sri Lanka has to offer. Amesh Wijesekera Unveiling his collection for 2019 UK based
designer Amesh gave a sneak peek of what’s in store. Sticking to his signature style of
layered clothing using various textures. Amesh lived up to the hype that surrounds him.
Arean Zhou Exaggerated silhouettes were the order of the day in this collection which was
inspired by Italian artist Roberto Cuoghi’s work Il Coccodeista. Named Evolve, this
collection was unusual and highlighted the designer’s creative imagination. Sophie Beet
Swimwear in bright punchy colours graced the runway as sophie sent a collection of fun and
flirty swimwear. She believes that fashion is the most powerful tool to influence others
on the topic of covering up and reapplying sunscreen to reduce skin cancer. Mauro Medaglia
Embarking on a curious journey, Mauro was inspired by the sartorial research of Nick
Veasey’s X Ray art, where the outerwear is analaysed and decomposed like a cubist
painting.The jackets look overturned, the exterior becomes lining and the maxi pockets are
fitted as accessories. This collection provided an interpretation of an intellectual and
extravagant femininity, embodied in Peggy Guggenheim and in the fashion of the 40s. The
collection /Body Code/ is inspired by the body’s meridians and the water circulation
system in traditional Chinese medicine. It reflects TCM’s essence with gentle colour
contrasting, hand- stitched traditional Chinese Su embroidery, and delicate textures in
silk and wool. Maria Nava This collection took inspiration from Otto Dix and Felixmüller
paintings, the triadic ballet by Oskar Schlemmer and Soldier Uniforms and Wedding Gowns of
the 1920's. Her goal was to combine odd materials and silhouettes (elongated necklines,
armholes and waistbands) in order to portray the emotional and unstable mood of that era.
Stefan Vella Through this collection Vella explored the ambiguities and contradictions
that are part and parcel of living in a world that is becoming more dependent on
technology. Inspiration from high tech and performance gear were applied to garments that
might be considered inefficient and cumbersome. Menushi Jayatillake This collection
unravels a story through the blending of masculine materials and silhouettes, such as
pinstripes and crisp pattern cuttings used in men’s tailoring suits, with linen and other
fabrics, like cotton and satin. Whimsical materials are also added for an ultra-feminine
silhouette, making this a state-of-art collection. The key colours of this collection
consist of khaki, off-white and black. Sandani Perera The inspiration for Sandani’s debut
collection for SS19, “Structured flow” stems from contemporary minimal architecture, the
collection consists of silhouettes that are simple but have strong and intricate
detailing. Simplicity and quality are key. Fabric and manipulation techniques will be
inspired by the chosen theme. Natharlea Yahampath Narthelea’s 2019 collection is designed
with the collaboration of Sri Lankan artisans who have mastered the handicraft and
embroidery craft. This adds an exceptional value and a touch of modern luxury couture to
the entire collection. The collection silhouettes were inspired by power dressing for both
men and women Anum Dassanayake Elements such as nightlife, architecture, colours, people
and atmosphere come together in this collection to portray ""Beautiful Hell"" inspired by a
visit to Amsterdam. Colours ranged from near-blacks to romantic reds and skin tones. These
tones appear to have been cast to be viewed through a moonlit lens. Thushie Jayasekera
Inspired by the iridescent shades of the sea and the tropical colours of coral reefs and
fish, Sub-aquatic Glitch by TINK is a collection of ready to wear garments, consisting of
fringed mini dresses, embellished pieces and cover-ups capturing the movement and texture
of the magical world down under. Anuththara Rajapakse Inspired by 80’s sportswear, comics
and Harajuku fashion, this whimsical collection embodies a spirit of childish playfulness.The silhouettes are feminine yet fun, accentuated with a mix of bright and quirky
embellishments and fabrics that hint at transparency whilst generating volume and weight.
Sripratha Iyer Bringing the 1940's tailoring and the 1980's outerwear together by
hybridizing two or more different garments into one with couture techniques. Senalli
Ranatunga She created swimwear with cover ups inspired by British, Japanese and Russian
Ancient fishermen and sea life with digital prints, spray painting and inflatable
techniques Oshini Polwattage ‘Retrospective Fusion’ connects with late 60s’, early 70s’
silhouettes and geometricised versions of designs derived from French Gothic architectural
elements such as pinnacles and window tracery to bring out a contemporary tailored look.
While the sharp shoulder lines and tamed silhouettes provide the sharpness, checked paper
boy hats and clear round glasses gives a chic look to the overall mood of the collection.
Naveena Pushparaj Using 1950s Hawaiian and tropical illustrations for her inspiration, she
has extracted colour palettes and illustration styles for her prints. Most of her prints
are derived from hand illustration work and furthered through digital design. The
silhouettes are taken from bomber jackets and tailored ideas from which she has adapted
and created a new, modern and wearable collection. Imasha De Silva This collection was
inspired by the silhouettes of ranch girls and Prairie girls. The Prairie girls influenced
the feminine feel to the collection, while insect prints were inspired by vintage insect
botanical drawings and antique Valentine’s Day cards inspired the print of the roses. The
colours of the silhouettes were inspired by vintage posters with ruffles and snake-skin
used as a nod to the ranch girl. Ruvishka Peiris The concept ‘Exurbia’ has an architecture
that has been developed to a more dramatic feel. It was inspired by the two architects,
Zaha Hadid and Oscar Niemeyer. Along with it the main inspiration for the prints were
through marbles. Mewuni Ranasinghe Workwear inspired denim collection combines iconic
visual elements of a painter by layering textiles with hand embroidery, hand paintings and
bleaching techniques. Rachel Sylvester A collection themed 'Alice in Wonderland' with
garments that give prominence to femininity with 70's garment inspirations incorporated
with vibrant colours and enhanced with prints and attention to detailing. Maneesha
Fernando This collection is a clash of cultures, using the fruit shops of Sri Lanka as
inspiration. Fernando worked with a traditional craft and updated it for a modern context
using all of her own drawings. The collection is a fun, fruity collection inspired by
Dolce and Gabanna and Italian eccentricity. Harshanya Iyer The masculinity of the 1980s’
tailoring meets the elegance of the 1930s’ evening gowns to produce a romantic, feminine,
yet masculine womenswear collection. Sarah Afzal Bringing out the idea of deconstruction
while referring to 1940s’ tailoring. showcased in a capsule collection that will emphasise
on print, embellishment and fabric manipulation. Pabasari Kaluthanthri The concept was
inspired by the dress of plague doctors who prevailed from the 17th to the 19th century.
As these costumes had bird like features, Pabasari based her print and embroidery on birds
and traditional Sri Lankan bird motifs. She used 16th-century garments as her main
inspiration which includes detailed capes, jackets and gowns. Ashini Silva The fusion of
ancient Ceylon and 1980s’ tailoring combines the essence of nostalgia in a contemporary
context through the application of ‘deconstruction’ methods to reconstruct new
silhouettes. Textured fabrics such as linens and cottons create an interesting hand feel
while giving anatural feel to the garments accompanied with the organic colours which have
been explored and refined through natural methods. Thamoda Wickramasinghe The concept for
this collection is a fusion of 1950s and 1970s silhouettes with Shaman costume and
detailing. Tailoring techniques, shapes and details are paired with interesting
embroidery, beautiful fabrics and intricate bead-work to create a collection with a
contemporary modern take on tradition. Deanne Edirisuriya This collection is influenced by
ancient samurai costumes and robotic exoskeletons, creating a tailored collection with
oriental aesthetics. Thilini Silva This collection is about contrast between volume andfit inspired by Hanboks, late 1960s’ early 1970s’ corsets. It incorporates silks hand
painted and dyed in shades of soft pink highlighting an ethereal and feminine feel.
Pramodi Wickramarachchi This collection is inspired by the iconic silhouettes and
construction of vintage Cristobal Balenciaga garments and the audacity of the true Punk
spirit. It's a story of a closeted Renegade. A Silhouette caught between refinement and
rebellion. The collection is categorised under ""Prêt-à- Couture"" for its use of couture
luxury with the practicality of RTW. Leshani Peiris Inspiration stems from tailoring
techniques and pattern mixing of the late 1940s to 1950s menswear and structural aspects
of medieval suits of armour, a menswear collection that challenges the traditional men's
sartorial silhouette. Punna Withanaarachchi “Sporty couture” is all about luxury
athleisure where it is not only limited to casual wear but also a glamorous attire. This
collection is a combination of the 80s’ athleisure,50s’ silhouettes and components from
the hunting jackets. The print inspiration for the collection is coming from the paintings
of Kenneth Norland and the graffiti art from the Berlin wall. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is

life_fashion90_1_Remembering_Karl_Lagerfeld_The_Kaiserof_Fashion.pdf,"Remembering Karl Lagerfeld: The ’’Kaiser’’of Fashion
Feb 20 2019. What Picasso was to art, Karl Lagerfeld was to fashion, the legendary fashion
designer drew his last breath on the 19th of February 2019 at the age of 85, an immense
loss of immeasurable portions for the world of fashion felt by celebrities and designers
alike with tweets and posts flooding all social media platform in memory of the fashion
titan. Born in Germany as Karl Otto Lagerfeldt he dropped the “t” in his surname for he
felt it to be “more commercial” and moved to Paris as a teenager to begin his iconic
career. Lagerfeld certainly liked to keep busy (he worked until the end of his life), he
was the creative director for both Chanel, Fendi and his own eponymous label. “The Kaiser
of fashion” was also an accomplished photographer, he would photograph his own campaigns
and would then go on to exhibit his work in Europe. He really liked expressing himself
through sketches and ones said that “to me drawing is like breathing and writing, these
are things that almost relax me.” He collaborated with Faber Castell to create a limited
edition (only 2500 boxes were made) 350 pieces drawing tool kit called “Karlbox” that cost
a whopping $2850! It certainly had designers and artist salivating from sheer delirious
joy. His journey in fashion started in 1955 as Pierre Balmain’s assistant who really took
to his sketches that won him first place at the international Woolmark prize, after a few
years lapsed and he embarked on a freelance career for Tiziani, Valentino and Chole, he
was offered the role of creative director at the Luxury Italian fashion house Fendi in
1965 and subsequently was appointed the head designer for Chole. In 1983 he was made
artistic director for Chanel and breathed in new life to the “near-dead brand” and made it
lot more appealing to the younger crowd, he was also the brains behind the now infamous
interlocked “CC” monograph that the label is known for. In 1984 he launched his own
namesake label “Karl Lagerfeld”. Lagerfeld briefly ventured out into the world of fast
fashion where he collaborated with Swedish fast fashion giant H&M to make his designs more
accessible to the mass market making him the first high fashion brand to do so before it
became a common occurrence. In 2011 Model Baptiste Giabiconi gifted Lagerfeld a beautiful
Birman cat who he named Choupette (which means sweetie in French) who he adores so much he
even ones said he would marry her if he could and admits that she is spoilt rotten and
won’t eat on the floor but takes her meals on the table with him. The kitty certainly
lives a diva lifestyle, accompanying him to fashion shows and jet setting around the globe
with Lagerfeld in his private jet, she also has over 100,000 followers on her Instagram
account “Choupette diary” where follower can get a glimpse into her very privileged life.
Lagerfeld is known to be a very outspoken person and never shy away from what he thinks,
you can never say he didn’t have an opinion and would always express what he feels and
this would build a bit of controversy around him. His outrageously controversial opinions
would be on varied topics like women’s bodies where he had a rather immense fixation on
and wasn’t too kind towards overweight people, he ones said Adele was “a little too fat,
but she has a beautiful face and divine voice.” Lagerfeld would staunchly defend his use
of fur in his collection going on to say, “In a meat-eating world, wearing leather for
shoes and even clothes, the discussion of fur is childish.” Headlines were created when he
expressed his anger towards German Chancellor Angela Merkel for accepting Syrian refugees
“One cannot – even if there are decades between them – kill millions of Jews so you can
bring millions of their worst enemies in their place,” When asked about the #metoo
movement he went on to say that he was “fed up with it, what shocks me most in all of this
are the starlets who have taken 20 years to remember what happened. Not to mention the
fact there are no prosecution witnesses” certainly knows how to widen your eyes with shock
Whether you love him or hate him, find him to be an unequivocal genius or offensive, one
cannot deny his contribution to the world of fashion in his career spanning over 64 years.
he is one of the if not the greatest designers of our time and his loss will certainly befelt, but the legacy he created that goes hand in hand with his iconic image of the
slicked-back ponytail, dark sunglasses and shirt collar turned up he is certainly etched
in our memories as a remarkable character of our time who was, in his words “I am down to
earth, just not this earth.” Your comment (*)",4703

life_fashion90_20_Aviva_Bidapa_-_Diving_into_the_deep_end.pdf,"Aviva Bidapa - Diving into the deep end
Aug 19 2019. Nurturing her passion for swimwear, actress turned designer Aviva Bidapa
recently launched her swimwear collection at The Design Collective. The daughter of
legendary all things fashion, Prasad Bidapa, Aviva decided to swim upstream with her
desire to venture into swimwear when she met with Sri Lanka based Linea Aqua. Fresh off
the runway at the recently concluded Olu Swim Week Colombo, Aviva’s swimwear is fresh and
exciting with a frisson of excitement. A self confessed waterbaby when Aviva wanted to
marry her passion for creativity and business it seemed natural to take the plunge with
swimwear. For many women donning swimwear can be a daunting prospect but Aviva says “I
want people to understand and be comfortable in swimsuits as all girls have different
bodies and insecurities about their body. Therefore, I hope that they will feel
comfortable in my swimwear, inside and out.” How did you get into swimwear? My wardrobe
consists of a hundred swimsuits. I absolutely love them. I’ve been obsessed since I was
sixteen years old. I remember chatting with my dad one day and I remember him saying that
he wanted to start something, and I didn’t believe him at that time. I was so excited, and
I asked him, “Do you really think this is plausible?” and he said “Absolutely!” From then
onwards we started exploring. We visited Linea Aqua. Everything came together and it has
been a dream ever since. For this collection, what is your inspiration? I love mixing
usability with couture. The women I have catered to range from 18 to 35-40 years of age
and they want something that is in style and something that everybody is seeking. I kept
that in mind, and also keep it very different. If you look at my collection, it doesn’t
tell a story but I have friends who prefer varying styles, so I wanted to keep it open to
everybody. Do you have anyone in mind when you design the swimwear? I have to say Sony
Kaur and Pratheek Jain. They have been friends of mine for so long and the way they
conduct themselves is what I really love. How many collections have you put out? As of
now, one. I am really busy during the year as I also work with my father in event
management. I want to put my heart and soul into one collection and eventually, when I
find time, I will produce two collections. How do you think the Sri Lankan community will
respond to it? What I love about Sri Lanka and their designers is that they are all
creative and they are willing to take a chance and they don’t have any reservations when
it comes to fashion. With my designs being loud and out there, I think the Sri Lankan
community will respond very well, and I hope they do. Sri Lanka is my second home; I visit
the country twice or thrice a year. I love the people and I love the culture, so I really
hope they love it. What next for the Aviva brand? I believe my next move will be moving
into resort wear as I love and spend my time in resorts. What plans for the next season?
My next season may revolve around neon, as I’m into it these days and with a little hint
of classy, it may be my favourite thing. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_20_Buzz_with_Danu_-__Nilusha_Shivaraj__Heshani_Bogollogama.pdf,"Buzz with Danu - Nilusha Shivaraj & Heshani Bogollogama
Sep 17 2025. Isle of Rataa x Sahesh by IoR is where island vibes meet fierce fashion – and
honestly, it’s giving everything we need right now! Behind the magic are Nilusha Shivaraj
and Heshani Bogollogama – two powerhouse women who basically said, “Sri Lankan fashion
deserves a global runway… and we’re bringing it!” From breezy resort wear that makes you
want to pack your bags and escape to the Maldives, to those drop-dead-gorgeous pieces that
scream main character energy – these brands are all about confidence, colour, and a little
bit of sass. On Buzz with Danu today, I’m sitting down with Nilusha & Heshani to spill the
chai on building two killer labels, staying inspired, and proving that Sri Lankan fashion
can be both local and luxe. 1. What inspired you to start Isle of Rataa and Sahesh by IOR?
Was there a defining moment or experience that made you decide to launch? Isle of Rataa
(IoR) started in 2020, right in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, born from our love
for Sri Lankan handicrafts and our passion for working with local artisans. During that
time, many of our artisans were struggling because tourism, which was their main source of
income, had completely stopped. That’s when the idea came to us: what if we took their
incredible skills and brought them into a new space, like homeware? We were all stuck at
home for months on end, and we kept thinking, why shouldn’t our homes feel beautiful with
functional works of art? A few years later, in 2023, Sahesh by IoR was born out of another
love of ours — jewellery. Sri Lanka has such a rich jewellery heritage, with styles and
traditions that differ across the island. We wanted to take that history and make it part
of everyday life, creating jewellery that feels both modern and wearable, while still
carrying the soul of our culture. 2. “Traditional handmade crafts with a modern twist” is
a tagline I saw—can you share how you strike the balance between preserving tradition and
innovating? The craft behind our products is rooted in traditions that have been passed
down through generations of artisan families. We take this specialised skillset and
reimagine it by creating pieces that are not only beautiful to look at but also practical
in everyday life. In doing so, we keep these age-old crafts alive while giving them a
place in the modern world. 3. Can you walk us through the journey of a product—from
concept to finished piece? For example, what steps are involved in creating a hand-
engraved brass jewellery piece? When it comes to jewellery design, every line we create
begins with a story. We always ask ourselves, which part of Sri Lanka’s heritage are we
trying to showcase here? That becomes our starting point. From there, our designers take
the tradition and push it forward, creating pieces that feel fresh, unique, and meaningful
for our customers. Once the design is ready, we sit down with our artisans to bring it to
life. Sometimes, a single piece of jewellery can involve multiple artisans, each
contributing their own specialised skill. And before it reaches our customers, every piece
goes through careful quality checks to make sure it carries the standard and soul we stand
for. 4. How do you source your materials, and what criteria do you use (e.g.
sustainability, quality, local vs imported)? All of our products are 100% handmade right
here in Sri Lanka, using materials sourced locally. For example, our palmyrah products are
made by the leaves that come from palmyrah trees that grow in the Northern Province,
meanwhile our talipot products are made from the leaves of tala tree that can be found in
Sabaragamuwa or North WesternProvince. 5. How do you come up with new collections or
designs? Is there a design philosophy, seasonal inspiration, or collaborative process with
artisans? Of course, some of our designs are inspired by a seasonal aspect, such as
Avurudu or Christmas. However, our main inspiration is Sri Lankan flora and fauna for Isle
of Rataa and Sri Lankan heritage for Sahesh by IoR. When we first started, especially with
our batik homeware, we would share our ideas with the artisans and then let them interpret
them in their own way. After all, every one of our artisans is an artist, and it was
fascinating to see how differently each of them brought the same concept to life. Now, wealso have a team of designers working closely with us. They design the products, meet with
the artisans, and collaborate to ensure each idea can come to life using traditional
techniques. It’s a collaborative process, blending creativity and craftsmanship together.
6. Which piece(s) are you most proud of so far, and why? (Could be for craftsmanship,
story, or impact.) Lately, what we’re most excited and proud about is our new Sahesh
collection, especially the two standout pieces, the Makara Mala and the Binara Mal set.
This collection was truly a team effort. From our designers sketching the first ideas to
the many artisans who each added their craft and skill, every detail was a collaboration.
And when it all came together, these pieces carried a special kind of energy. Seeing them
shine on the Ramp Up 2025 stage was one of those moments that reminded us why we do what
we do. 7. How does Sahesh by IOR differ in design and target audience from Isle of Rataa’s
other offerings? What sets Sahesh by IoR apart is its focus on artisanal jewellery, while
Isle of Rataa is centred around homeware, lifestyle, and handicrafts. With Sahesh, our aim
is to celebrate the incredible variety of jewellery traditions across Sri Lanka and to
make them accessible to everyone who loves jewellery, whether it’s bold statement pieces
or everyday designs. Right now, we’re especially excited about working with Kandyan
jewellery, adapting it for daily wear. One of the most fascinating things we’ve discovered
on this journey is how diverse Sri Lanka’s jewellery heritage really is. Did you know that
each region has its own style, its own designs, and even its own materials? That’s the
story we want Sahesh to tell. 8. You launched “Rataa at Selyn” in partnership to help
bring more opportunities to your artisans. How have partnerships like this contributed to
your growth, and what challenges have you encountered? Partnerships are a cornerstone of
our business; even our relationships with our artisans are treated like a partnership.
This always leads to more collaborative ideas and growth, we have been lucky to connect
with partners who understand and share our core values and missions. Our most recent
partnership was with the Faculty of Visual Arts to launch our first internship program for
Arts students. Called ‘Design at Rataa’, our interns receive a hands-on experience of the
ins & outs of running a business, from designing a product to producing it to selling it
and customer handling and in turn, we nurture a new generation of designers and give them
space to grow with us. 11. What are some of the biggest challenges of running a
craftnbased business in Sri Lanka (logistics, scaling, marketing, preserving quality,
etc.)? How have you overcome them? Given that we work with artisans and each piece is
crafted by hand, time naturally becomes part of the process. These aren’t pieces that can
be made in a day, since every piece is meticulously designed and crafted by hand. And
that’s also what makes them special: no two pieces are ever exactly the same. Of course,
this also means we can’t produce in large quantities or at lightning speed. In a world
where everything is expected instantly, that can feel like a challenge. However, for us,
it’s worth it, because what you receive isn’t just another product, it’s something truly
unique. 9. How has customer reception been, both locally in Sri Lanka and internationally,
if you serve global customers? Since we launched, the response from our customers has been
incredible! Our first cushion cover – the Monstera cushion cover- sold out in a week. Ever
since then, we have hit the ground running. While we rely on our online presence for
sales, our best asset is word of mouth. There’s nothing better than meeting a customer
who’s come to us because a friend or family member recommended our work. Those connections
are truly our most valuable asset. Another segment of our customers is Sri Lankans living
abroad, and we love that our products give them a little slice of home to keep with them,
wherever they are. We also work with Sri Lankans overseas who run their own businesses and
want to bring a touch of Sri Lankan craftsmanship into their spaces. 10. In terms of
impact, how do you see Isle of Rataa contributing to the preservation of traditional
crafts, livelihoods of artisans, or broader cultural heritage? IoR contributes to
preserving traditional crafts by continuously running training programs. In 2021, we ran atraining program in Kottagala to develop 150 new female artisans. In 2022, we ran a
training program in the village of Rajagananya, who did Rush and Reed artisans by further
developing their skillset by 11. What are your plans for the future—are there new product
categories, new markets, or new collaborations you’re excited about? Our next exciting
step is the opening of our first physical store! This has been in the works for the past
year, and we are nearing the opening date. As consumer trends have moved from online
shopping to in-person shopping, we are keeping up with our customers' requests by opening
our flagship store in the heart of Colombo in Horton Place, Colombo 07. 15. How do you
envision the craft and design landscape in Sri Lanka evolving over the next 5–10 years,
and what role would you like Isle of Rataa / Sahesh by IOR to play in that? We would like
to see ourselves grow to be leaders in the industry and expand the love of Sri Lankan
craft and design not only in Sri Lanka but also internationally. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with

life_fashion90_20_Designer_1-2-1_Ashleen_Adhikari.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Ashleen Adhikari
Feb 09 2021. Launching her new streetwear brand Sita, Ashleen Adhikari a student of the
AOD has created her latest collection called Marigolds. For Ashleen, Sita represents a
long-awaited need of a cultural, yet spoken streetwear brand in Sri Lanka. Sita speaks of
a rich fabric story created by using authentic crafts and techniques, while at the same
time giving them a modern perspective with digitized handloom patterns and colour
alignment. Ashleen seeks to combine two crafts to create one fabric. What sparked your
interest in fashion design? To be honest, fashion was not even on my list of what I would
like to pursue. I always wanted to be a “I want to be a pilot” type of girl, but down the
line, I noticed that I have a unique eye and way of doing things, and everything just
happened spontaneously at the time and here I am studying third-year fashion marketing.
What made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? As I learnt more
about the industry and the subject, I realized there are major voids in the industry.
Therefore I was eager to find solutions, I always questioned. I guess that curiosity
sparked an interest and a desire to take fashion more seriously. Where do you look for
creative inspirations? As cliche, as it sounds, in design school my main design hot spot,
is ‘INSTAGRAM.’ There are amazing talent and inspiration up there if you know where to
look. Also, Behance is also one of my constants in the search bar. Describe your latest
collection? My latest collection is called ‘MARIGOLDS’. It relates the story of how a
garment can be generated from person to person, with a new story, new life and new
perspectives. The Marigold project is an example of expressing one’s authentic self. Who
is your muse? I don’t necessarily have a specific muse, but whoever I meet in my everyday
life gradually becomes the focus for my collections. However, I’m fascinated by one
amazing lady who feeds life into my collection. Mrs Iona Halpe who goes by ionanana. She
is an amazing woman with an incredible taste for fashion. She’s such a role model and as a
person is the kindest person you’ll meet. I’ve been spending a lot of time with her during
this lockdown understanding her past, her life stories her values and principles which
eventually became the concept for ‘MARIGOLDS.’ What are your sustainability credentials?
One of my strongest practices is slow fashion. I really do believe that slow fashion makes
a drastic change. Sita itself represents timeless yet authentic pieces highlighting the
importance of slow fashion. Moreover, Sita gives solutions, different aesthetics on how
one can style their garments for multipurpose wear. What are you fascinated by at the
moment and how does it feed into your work? Actually, I received my mom's old clothes
recently and a few photographs of her in them, few tales of her and her young days which
inspired and clearly feeds into this collection alongside Mrs Iona. What is the biggest
lesson that you have learned since you started your company? Nothing is ever boring.
Everything has its individuality and essence and I’m curious to observe and learn more.
What is your motto? Live by your true authenticity and don’t be afraid to feed energy into
your own aesthetics express yourself in everything you do. What is your favourite part
about being a designer? Freedom to explore. The feeling of always having the opportunity
to bring out something new to the audience. What role do you feel social media plays in
fashion? Social media plays a huge role in fashion I guess and especially as a marketer, I
realized that social media is sort of the backbone for every brand to bloom, especially
when you are catering to the future generations. How do you want women to feel when
wearing your clothes? Empowered, unique and authentic. I want every woman/man to be able
to be proud of their story with Sita. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_20_Designer_1-2-1_Sajini_Hulugalle.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Sajini Hulugalle
Nov 02 2021. Savouring success since she launched her eponymous brand at The Design
Collective last month, designer Sajini Hulugalle is already planning her next collection.
A qualified fashion designer, Sajini’s outlook on fashion is to design clothes for
comfort. What made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Having
always had an interest in fashion and clothing, I knew very early on that I wanted to have
a career in design and I wanted to learn more about the process and the craft of design
and what went into creating a garment. Having been involved in merchandising since I
finished my studies, only recently since having my baby, decided to seriously follow my
passion and start my own brand. Are you self-taught or did you study fashion design? I got
my Bachelor’s in Technology in Design from the National Institute of Fashion Technology in
New Delhi. As I come from a background where I don’t have any ties to the fashion industry
or a chance to learn the practical aspect of fashion, I wanted to learn all there is about
this field. I was very fortunate to study at NIFT where we had 4 years of intensive
training in Illustration, Draping, Pattern Making, Garment construction as core modules
with subjects in marketing, Batik, Embroidery, metal work & even clay as subjects where we
could really explore our creativity. How has your work evolved since you began your own
label? As I mentioned earlier, I have always been very fascinated with fashion and my
first “project” when I was in my teens was to cut the hem off my blue jeans to make
cropped distressed pants (something I still do to-date). My first love in clothes though,
has always been dresses or gowns, evening wear, casual, resort etc. And I have lost the
number of evening or occasion wear I have made for friends and family as well as myself
and that I would have to say is the backbone of my brand even today. Beautiful dresses
have always been a mainstay for me. As it’s still my debut collection, I would have to say
my work is still evolving and it’s exciting to see where it would lead. Are there any
types of clothing that you avoid designing? During my training, I have formal education in
all types of clothing like menswear, childrenswear, lingerie etc. so I would not like to
say I want to avoid any type of clothing as a designer. Where do you look for creative
inspiration? Nature, books, everyday life & most importantly fabric itself. Describe your
latest collection. This collection is definitely a very different look from what I usually
design and I feel that the change around us in the world today and most importantly the
most significant change in my life in becoming a first-time mother has made a big impact
in creating a line where comfort comes first. The colours are very earthy with vibrant
saffron and soft greens and pinks. None of the dresses in this collection have fasteners
like buttons or zips or hooks, which was a deliberate move while designing. They are all
made for ease with touches of bows and frills for beauty. Who is your muse? It’s a real
woman with real issues who just wants to take the time she has and feel beautiful without
having to worry what the world thinks of her. She knows how to juggle her time between
work and family and also kick up her heels and have a cocktail and a good time at the end
of the day and then wake up and do it all again. What are your sustainability credentials?
I do my best to use eco-friendly materials and with a zero tolerance towards fabric
wastage to recycle the scraps and pieces to create new garments. We are also encouraging
recycle and upcycle old outfits instead of getting rid of them. What are you fascinated by
at the moment and how does it feed into your work? Definitely how the world around us has
changed, and in doing so, changed everything from food choices to fashion choices. We now
look for comfort in every area. Our high heels have been kept on shelves while we tuck our
feet under us on a comfortable sofa. So I’m very fascinated with exploring how comfort can
be re-introduced in to our closet staples. What is the biggest lesson that you have
learned since you started your company? That everything can change in a blink of an eye
and we have to learn to adapt and flow with the changes. Which international or localdesigners are you inspired by? Valentino, Ralph & Russo, Zuhair Murad, Prabal Gurung,
Manish Malhotra & Darshi Keerthisena. What role do you think social media plays in fashion
today? I think social media plays a very important part in fashion today, social media
presence is what makes a brand relevant to its consumers & cements its acceptance in
society. With the world of influencers, whether we like it or not, consumers look up to
who they feel are influencers when deciding if a certain brand or item of clothing is
worth it. What is your favourite part about being a designer? I love the whole process of
putting pencil on paper and creating a visual image of what’s only in my mind and then
bringing that pencil image to life with fabric and movement and colour. How do you want
women to feel when wearing your clothes? I want women to feel beautiful, that’s why we buy
a dress. I want my customers to feel comfortable & happy when they wear my clothes. A
beautiful dress helps in making you feel confident even on the worst days & that’s the
feeling I want every woman to feel when they buy one of my designs. Tina Edward

life_fashion90_20_Fashionably_Danu_-_Dr_Slim.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu - Dr. Slim
Jun 06 2017. Today I work with a young brand, which has caught the true essence of the
youth, from the trendy cuts and the fits, the T-shirts show an international outlook, and
the maker for this brand is Kanchana Delgoda. All the designs which are featured can be
purchased at JUMP. Why have you named your brand Dr. Slim? And why? To be honest, the name
Dr. Slim has a bit of a history. It's coupled with my love for music from my days in
school, so by naming my brand Dr. Slim, I feel that I connect with it more with a sense of
who I am and what I love. How would you describe your personal style? Well, I do keep up
with the new trends and try them out but my personal style is more about how comfortable
and confident I am when wearing something. What international brands have inspired you?
There are a few to name but basically any clothing brand with excellent quality and
comfortable fabric along with a great fit. How do you work on the designs you create? I am
always on the lookout for latest trends, so when I see a fabric I kind of envision what I
want to create with that piece of fabric. From there on, I work hard on getting the
perfect design and the perfect cut. I pay close attention to each detail, from the stitch
to the button. It's a long process but when you see the end result, it's all worth it.
What are your thoughts on the local market? As we designers are, most consumers are also
on the lookout for the latest fashion trends. They are concerned about the quality and
value for money as well. So if you are able to create something that is fashionable, with
great quality and value then there is always a great market for your creations. What
according to you is a favourite part of being a fashion designer? For me, it's being able
to create something new and to see someone embrace it with as much love and care as you
have for it. You get to be a part of their lives in a way and when you see someone wearing
one of your creations, that's just priceless! Who do you envision wearing your work? Do
you think about this when you work on designs? Well, someone like you Danu, who has a
great and unique personality with a great sense of style. Someone who adds a bit of
themselves to whatever they wear and let it shine through instead of just letting the
clothes wear you. What skills, according to you are necessary for a successful fashion
designer? Amongst many other skills, I think creativity, a good eye for material and
knowledge of latest fashion trends are the key skills that every fashion designer must
have. What interested you to work and create an exclusive range for men? Will there be
anything for women in the future? I myself have struggled many a time to find clothes that
suit me or clothes that I'd like to wear. That's what made me want to work on a range for
men. In terms of a line for women, I did produce some great designs and I hope to do the
same in the near future. How would you describe a Sri Lankan man's fashion and style? I
think they are conscious about what makes them ""look good"", and depending on the person
and the occasion it can be smart, casual, funky or edgy which is great because it gives us
fashion designers ample opportunity to create something for everyone and make them all
look great. Speaking to Arantha, who is also the designer's friend, this is what he had to
say... What are your thoughts on the prints of this collection? The print of Dr. Slim
comes in vibrant colours and designs, which the modern day youngsters like to wear as
street and casual styles. What look do you feel will move well in Sri Lanka? The shirt
with the camouflage print will be a good buy among teenagers in Sri Lanka. My personal
choice would be the plain coloured T-shirts and polo shirts. What are the looks you would
like to see with Dr. Slim? I would like to see Dr. Slim going on to do custom designed
T-shirts and shirts for selective clients as it will create a niche market for the brand.

Jun 21 2017. Today I feature young talent! I got to see his work on social media and fell
in love with it immediately, so had to get in touch with him and get his work out to see
for myself. Ranga who is now working in the fashion industry, has a unique flavour to his
work, and he is a designer who designs costumes for his clients, and today we feature his
collection of chic street wear, which was a fun shoot to be a part of. What makes your
designs unique? I use my prints to enhance the uniqueness of my designs. They are hand
illustrations which are developed as graphics at the end. How would you describe your
personal style? My personal style is a blend of fashion and art. What international brands
have inspired you? Alexander McQueen, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Versace and few more
designer wear brands. How do you work on the designs you created? It depends, with
different inspirations and concepts but I'm always focused on making wearable and sellable
products. What are your thoughts on the local market, and what is the competition like for
original creations? The Sri Lankan fashion industry has already pitched the high end of
quality work and design values. It would be of better potential to compete with the
international industry in the future if we will be able to secure the originality of our
work. What, according to you, is a favourite part of being a fashion designer? It's a huge
pleasure to work on something that I'm so in love with and to see someone wearing
something I created. Who do you envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when
you work on your designs? Obviously, in my work, I'm trying to keep the high end of
tailoring and design qualities. So, I would love to see them being worn by people who
value and admire fashion in their lifestyles. Possibly fashion icons and celebrities,
someday. What skills, according to you, are necessary for a successful fashion designer?
Originality of someone's knowledge in both designing and technical fields will make a good
fashion designer. Tell me about your interest in art, and what your style is like? I'm a
big fan of many art cultures. I doodle and draw as a hobby. My style depends on concepts.
I'm trying on different techniques for different outcomes. Tell me about the collection
you have featured today, and what has been your inspiration for it? These are few looks
from my graduation collection. That was a men's casual wear collection inspired by a set
of hand illustrations. The theme of this collection was 'Mystical Trance'. Today, I work
with Nuwan Tharanga from X IRIS Portraiture, and spoke to him about the experience with
the shoot... What was it like to shoot this street chic look? Challenging and very
interesting, and I always love to do new shoots like this, and most importantly it's a new
concept. What was your favourite pick? Personally, I have always loved the opposite colour
contrast. The black and white photograph is my favourite. Designer - Ranga Senavirathne

life_fashion90_20_Nimesha_Wijewardana_Making_a_career_in_fashion.pdf,"Nimesha Wijewardana: Making a career in fashion
Jul 12 2024. Young entrepreneur Nimesha Wijewardana always knew her career lay in fashion.
From her young days she dreamed of being a designer. Today she is the proud owner of
fashion brand Jane Rabel which is stocked in her store Fashion Hut on the High Level Road
at Gansaba Junction in Nugegoda. The large store is well laid out and has a range of
clothing to cater to most. Displaying an excellent work ethic this young mum of one has
great plans for her newly opened store. Q WHAT INSPIRED YOU TO START YOUR FASHION LABEL,
JANE RABEL? I was interested in a career in fashion since my younger days. My mother used
to stitch me new fashionable outfits each week which everyone praised. I always had this
mind set to be an entrepreneur someday. I am quite passionate about fashion, I thought the
industry that suits me the best was fashion. So here I am with the brand Jane Rabel and
Fashion Hut. Q HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE BRAND IDENTITY OF JANE RABEL? In fact, the
meaning of “Jane Rabel” is basically “Gang of Women”. Initially our target was to launch
trending designs to the young. Now with the new expansion we are focusing on all ages and
a new store concept was launched to cater to a wide variety of fashion needs for all
genders and kids. So all the brands will be under one store by the name “Fashion Hut."" A
few more brands are to be launched in the coming months. Additionally we are looking at
doing a plus size collection too. Q WHAT ARE THE CORE VALUES AND PHILOSOPHY BEHIND JANE
RABEL? We mainly focus on quality, customer focus, innovation and reliability. Q HOW DO
YOU ENSURE YOUR DESIGNS REMAIN UNIQUE AND TRUE TO YOUR BRAND? First, we get a clear idea
on what we need to achieve and what target audience we need to reach with our designs.
Starting from the fabric selection, we maintain our focus until the finished product. We
also do market research, analyze and get feedback from experts. Q HOW DO YOU BALANCE
CREATIVITY WITH THE COMMERCIAL ASPECTS OF RUNNING A FASHION LABEL? Understanding the
target audience and their preferences is crucial. Researching current trends, identifying
gaps in the market, and seeing what resonates with our ideal customer informs our creative
decisions and ensure our designs have commercial appeal. Q WHO IS YOUR TARGET AUDIENCE,
AND HOW DO YOU ENGAGE WITH THEM? Well, that’s an interesting question. Fashion target
audiences are incredibly diverse, with preferences as varied as the styles themselves. So,
for now we are specific to women's fashion and like I stated above we will be expanding
the range to cater to all genders. We always use our social media platforms to engage with
our audience. Q HOW HAS CUSTOMER FEEDBACK INFLUENCED YOUR COLLECTIONS OVER TIME? We
started with a younger generation and based on our customer feedback we decided to expand
the product range to all categories and all age groups. That’s why the Fashion Hut store
concept was launched. We are happy to say that we were able to maintain the highest rating
out of a large number of customer feedback in one of the main social media platforms. You
hardly see this in most of the fashion labels in the country. Q WHAT CAN CUSTOMERS EXPECT
WHEN THEY VISIT FASHION HUT? The visual merchandise with curated displays. The store
arranges the clothing in a way that showcases different styles and outfits. This can help
to visualize how pieces might work together. Mood setting with music, lighting, and even
scent can all contribute to the overall atmosphere. A good Customer Service. We have
friendly staff on hand to answer questions, help to find specific items,and offer styling
advice. Spacious fitting rooms to try on clothes with ease. And more importantly the price
point. We sell garments for an affordable and reasonable price. We have a certain
allocated discount corner which is available for 365 days. Q WHAT ARE YOUR FUTURE PLANS
FOR JANE RABEL AND FASHION HUT? We already have discussed with certain international
fashion chains to display the Jane Rabel brand globally. And we are planning to expand the
business to the main big cities in the island. Pix courtesy Jane Rabel Tina Edward

life_fashion90_20_The_Design_Collective_showcases_at_Toile_Mumbai.pdf,"The Design Collective showcases at Toile, Mumbai
Oct 15 2018. The Design Collective is set to wow fashion lovers in Mumbai when they hold
their first event collaborative retail event with Toile in Mumbai. Co-founders of The
Design Collective, Shahili Gomes and Binu Wickramasinghe are on a mission to take the
designers at The Design Collective to the rest of the globe and on this first mission to
India they will be showcasing a carefully curated collection which will complement Toile
which is a store in Mumbai, India with a strong focus on ethical fashion. How did this
opportunity come about? We have loved the work Toile has been doing on the sustainable
front and followed the store's success with interest. It's Mumbai’s first eco fashion
multi-brand store that also stocks some TDC Indian designers so we have much in common!
When Farheen invited us to curate a collection for Toile we were excited to collaborate
and give the Sri Lankan brands some exposure in a different market. On what basis did you
select the brands you did to showcase in India? We looked at our brands and identified
those who are most passionate about sustainability. There are commonalities between TDC
and Toile in terms of the Indian designers we stock and we have sought to avoid overlap.
We are therefore showcasing Sri Lankan designers that complement Toile and have curated
the collection accordingly. The brands that we have chosen are House of Lonali, Selyn and
Kantala . They are amazing sustainable brands focussing on different aspects of
sustainability. What do you aim to get out of this collaboration? Going forward how often
do you envisage doing such collaborations such as this? As often as we can! The whole
ethos at TDC is about creating a collective of like-minded people who support each other
and, where possible, collaborate. We are very excited to curate an edit for Toile and look
forward to working with Toile on similar projects in the future. Watch this space! Farheen
and Priti the co-founders of Toile are very keen to make this concept much bigger in Sri
Lanka and in India. We are hoping to collaborate with Toile and also other designers and
stores with interesting stories in the coming few weeks. How do you think this will impact
the Design Collective and the brands you intend to showcase? For many brands India is the
logical next step. It's a big market and it's on our doorstep. But it cuts both ways. Both
countries have a lot of learn from and offer the other in terms of design. This sort of
collaboration only strengthens the connection we have. Lonali's brand is already selling
in London and we are hoping that more of our TDC brands can start to look to international
markets. Almost all the brands at TDC have a story - we are only able to take 3 brands for
the time being but we have bigger plans for the collective and this is only the initial
step. We are looking at expanding the brands to other markets such as London. House of
Lonali and Kantala are already selling in London and we hope to have more brands expand in
the same way. How did you hear about Toile? A friend of mine introduced us to Toile.
Shahili and I both have a personal interest in sustainability and we like working with
brands who have a story. I met Farheen and Priti a few months ago when I traveled to Delhi
and we were very keen to do a collaboration in India and in Sri Lanka. How popular is TDC
among Tourists in Sri Lanka? We have a large customer based from India and other
countries. And we have returning customers who are traveling to Sri Lanka few times a year
on work and leisure and they always visit the store. This is one of the main reasons that
we have been wanting to expand to much larger markets such as India as we know that they
are keen on the designs and crafts that Sri Lanka has to offer. This is the first step in
doing so - taking SRI LANKAN brands to the next stage/level and exposing them to the
foreign markets. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_20_Yamamay_for_comfort_quality_and_style.pdf,"Yamamay for comfort, quality and style
Jan 07 2019. Lingerie is a big business the world over and Sri Lanka is no exception.
Italy’s premier lingerie brand Yamamay was launched in Sri Lanka recently amidst much
fanfare. In Sri Lanka especially for the launch, CEO Pinaoforte Group Francesco Pinto was
on hand to personally introduce the brand which has partnered up with Softlogic and will
be available at Odel. Commenting on the popularity of the brand, Pinto claimed that they
have over 500 stores in Italy along with 200 in other parts of the world. “Due to the
increasing popularity of the brand in addition to the 200 stores we have in other parts of
Europe we are looking to expand to Asia and beyond hence our presence in Sri Lanka in
partnership with Softlogic. We have some of our top suppliers here in Sri Lanka and we
believe that this is a good area to build our brand name. We are offering a product that
is different and we know Sri Lankan customers will like it” he added. “The name of our
brand Yamamay translates to butterfly in Japanese. This butterfly lives inland away from
pollution and thrives in a clean environment. There is a purity about this butterfly that
is also echoed in our product” Pinto explained. Speaking on the range of Yamamay products
which includes nightwear and swimwear and what differentiates it from other brands in the
market Pinto said “ We want our customers to feel good and fashionable. Our product gives
women a good shape and this is something that makes them happy. When you wear a garment
for 18 hours of the day it is very important that it has to be comfortable in addition to
be fashionable and beautiful. We use the best fabrics and technology to create our range
of products and this is what sets our brand apart” Yamamay will stock their Sculpt, Space
and Basic lingerie ranges, while the swimwear and sleepwear range is luxurious, glamorous
and feminine. Space has been described as the lightest and most breathable bra in the
world. A revolutionary item made from the innovative 3D Spacer fabric which gently
envelopes every woman's unique shape, it offers a pleasing feeling of comfort and greater
freedom of movement. Sculpt is a figure hugging shapewear, made in the innovative patented
100% ‘made in Italy stretch’; indeformable and breathable Sensitive® Sculpt fabric. The
Sculpt items slim the figure and comfortably accompany every movement, contributing to an
overall slinky, feminine, look. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

life_fashion90_21_Affordable_Clothing_Brands_in_Sri_Lanka.pdf,"Affordable Clothing Brands in Sri Lanka
Mar 27 2025. Today we are showing some love to a few of our very own local clothing
brands. Here are my top 4 great, yet lesser-known clothing brands in Sri Lanka that I came
across over the past couple of years. These emerging brands aren’t just making clothes;
they ‘re telling stories and empowering themselves and our communities. Every piece you
choose from one of these brands is more than just an outfit. It’s a piece of Sri Lanka,
crafted with love and care. The Cult Original - https://thecultoriginal.lk/ Instagram -
https://www.instagram.com/thecultoriginal/ If you’re looking to refresh your wardrobe with
some chic and cute pieces without breaking the bank, Flamingo SL is the place to be! I
have shopped at Flamingo SL many times and they never disappoint. This Sri Lankan brand
offers a fantastic selection of trendy clothes that are perfect for any occasion. What
makes Flamingo SL even more special is their commitment to supporting local design and
businesses. They opened their first store last year and it is a testament to this
commitment as there are many other local brands at the store. So while you shop for
clothes at Flamingo SL you can also shop for accessories under one roof. Their tops start
from LKR 2000, dresses and trousers from LKR 4000, and skirts from LKR 2500. Check out
their full range of clothes in-store or online. Flamingo SL - https://flamingosl.com/
Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/flamingosl_/ I absolutely love Absolute Basics! Let
me tell you why I love this Sri Lankan clothing brand. Sometimes all I want is to wear
really comfortable clothes and look nice in them. I always pick my absolute basics tops
and pants to do the job. They are made of high-quality, lightweight, and breathable
fabrics and I absolutely love them. AB clothes are perfect for Sri Lanka’s tropical
climate because it keeps you cool and comfortable all day long. They offer comfortable and
stylish pieces that are perfect for both casual outings and formal office settings.
Another big plus is that the prices are very reasonable for the quality you’re getting.
Tops and t-shirts start from LKR 2500, dresses from LKR 5500, pants from LKR 4500 and
there’s so much more to choose from. They have sales from time to time and prices drop
even more. Of course, don’t take my word for it… the best way to know if you’ll love it is
to try it out for yourself. Their flagship store is down Galle Road in Colpetty and they
also have a store in One Galle Face Mall. You can always check out their online store too.
AB - https://absolutebasics.lk/ Instagram -
https://www.instagram.com/absolutebasics/?hl=en I found Maia two years ago when I stumbled
upon their Christmas collection. It was so beautiful and elegant but had sold out by the
time I wanted to order. Since then, I have ordered from Maia from time to time and it
quickly became a favourite of mine for several reasons. Maia clothes have that classic
look that never goes out of style, but they also have a modern twist that makes them feel
elegant and current. Maia prices are so reasonable, so it’s easy to justify investing in
pieces that I’ll love for years to come. Their dresses are priced from LKR 5000 upwards.
Maia is definitely worth checking out. It’s a brand that truly embodies the spirit of Sri
Lankan fashion. Maia - https://www.maia.lk/ Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/maia.lk/
These are just a few examples of the incredible talent thriving in Sri Lanka's fashion
scene, there are so many more. So this is an invitation to find local brands, buy pieces
that resonate with you, and create your own unique style. Happy shopping! By Jessica

life_fashion90_21_Designer_1-2-1_Dulasha_Jayawardene.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Dulasha Jayawardene
Sep 14 2021. In 2020, despite a global pandemic ravaging businesses, designer Dulasha
Jayawardene took the brave step of launching her eponymous label. Drawn to a career in
fashion designer Dulasha graduated from the AOD and started her career working for
Victoria's Secret before taking the plunge and launching her own business. What sparked
your interest in fashion design? I have been an artist all my life. I have won quite a few
inter-school, island-wide & worldwide prizes as an artist. My love for fashion grew
further in my late teens when I was doing my AS Levels at Ladies’ College Colombo. What
really made me discover my latent affinity towards fashion was an art project which
involved drawing the human form in its entire range. I found myself drawn to drawing
garments that I would intuitively create based on the silhouettes I had sketched. What
made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Realising my innate
ability was a truly special moment in my life. This newfound way to project my creativity
seemed to align so perfectly with my quasi obsession with clothes and styling myself.
Delving further into the craft as an amateur further consolidated my resonance with this
art form. I simply loved it! At that point, I knew this is exactly what I wanted to
passionately pursue. Bringing my imagination to life and sharing it with those around me
became an almost tangible non-fungible dream. Are you self-taught or did you study fashion
design? After discovering my latent fashion art prowess, I was advised by my parents to
consider achieving an academic qualification and transforming from a fashion artist/
illustrator to a designer who is fully equipped with technical knowledge. I decided to
take their counsel to heart and joined the Academy of Design, Colombo. There I managed to
acquire skills and absorb technical knowledge which has proven to be pivotal. I completed
my bachelor’s degree in Fashion Design &Textile in 2016, at which point I began my
professional career at Brandix, designing for Victoria’s Secret (Victoria Sport). How has
your work evolved since you began your own label? Transitioning from a day job mentality
to a business owner mind space was a real struggle. I thought by doing a test collection I
might get a feel for it. To my dismay, it didn’t come easily to me even after that. It
was, however, a real eye-opening experience that gave me an indication of what is to come.
Conceptualising, Designing, Sourcing, Manufacturing, Quality Control were enough to
overwhelm me, and it was just the Production Workflow. Sorting out the brand and business
development along with the marketing and sales plans and the bookkeeping all together was
a real nightmare at the inception. I was lucky to have a great support system all around
me, starting with my family. This whole journey has been a real team effort. With time I
adjusted and learned to compartmentalise and be more efficient with my time. Through this
struggle, I have found more facets of myself which have influenced my design process and
creative output. This gradual growth has manifested in subtle ways in each piece of
clothing that I’ve created. It’s all in the details… This evolution continues to this day
as I am still a work in progress. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid
designing? At the core of it all, I love fashion design as an art form. As is the case
with all forms, Fashion Design prowess is a constant work in progress. Hence, there is no
particular type of clothing that I am prejudiced towards. Some are quite a task to sculpt
the way I want, and others are simpler. Instead of using that as a filter, I take it more
as a challenge. When I do eventually manipulate the shape to my desire, it is a palpable
joy! Where do you look for creative inspiration? I draw inspiration from art, emotions,
history, music, people, food, and my own life. Observing closely, time tested designer
brands such as Christian Dior, Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Versace, and many others, has also
helped me track the trends and derive inspiration from their creative direction. Modern
designer brands which have been causing a stir, such as Jacquemus and Proenza Schouler,
gives me an insight into current trends which are not influenced by a long lineage. I alsomake it a point to pay attention to contemporary style icons and stylists on Social Media
Platforms, such as, DuaLipa, Kylie Jenner, Lorenzo Posocco, Xenia Adonts, Danielle
Bernstein, Alexandra Pereira and Style Heroine. Vintage style icons, I believe deserve
just as must attention as the contemporary ones. I have taken notes from celebrities such
as Audrey Hepburn, Bianca Jagger, James Dean and Cher, to name a few. Describe your latest
collection? Our current collection which we called, ""Dark Twilight"", is an extrapolation
of our previous collection, ""Pastel Nature”, which was a bubbly, innocent and flamboyant
collection of garments, whereas Dark Twilight is an elegant evening wear collection
designed to invoke deeper and more mature sentiments. Dark Twilight is a collection of
pure Linen clothes which will effortlessly gravitate you to resonate with the nightlife
vibes, in style and comfort. The colour palette was inspired by the deeply saturated hues
of an impulsive painting of the late evening skies as seen from Galle Fort. This is a very
personal collection, as always, with a lot of sentimentalities attached. This collection
is a manifestation of deep emotions such as love, joy and passion, which were cherished at
that moment. During the design process I coalesced my imaginations with the inspirations I
drew from 1970's versions of Bianca Jagger and Cher. In the case of Bianca Jagger, she
also resonates immensely with one of our brand values which are to create high utility
clothing. Who is your muse? In my formative years, as most teenagers do, I took my cues
from the celebrities of that time. In my early 20s, I started to divert a fair bit from
the unimaginative and almost lazy route of popular culture references. I took great joy in
looking inwards and allowing my creativity to flow through. Every time I get inspired by
something or someone, I use that element to evolve my very own ideas. Every design I
create, I’d ask myself, “how does it resonate with me?"", ""does it go well with my
personality and my body type?"", ""what would this piece express about me, to the outside
world?”, among many other questions. I believe that doing this has helped me form unique
designs which tesselate harmoniously with each other and myself. What are your
sustainability credentials? At Dulasha, we make it a point to create true capsule
collections by designing and manufacturing clothes with high quality, longevity, utility,
and versatility. Sustainability, as a concept, emerged as an element of corporate ethics
as a retort to the clear long-term damage caused by a focus on short-term financial gains.
We endeavour to satiate the insatiable need to perpetually buy more clothes. Our
collections are designed and coalesced to have myriad unique stylish and elegant
combinations. Even individual pieces are designed to be able to be styled in more than one
way. This utility and versatility combined with our keen focus on quality and longevity
contribute to satisfying our purchasers and fulfilling their wardrobes needs. Furthermore,
we only use fabrics made from natural fibres. This is done primarily to ensure superior
comfort and to guarantee minimal impact on the environment. Being environmentally
conscious is a value that we are proud of. This all comes together to make, “Dulasha”, an
economically and environmentally sustainable clothing brand. What are you fascinated by at
the moment and how does it feed into your work? The current Autumn-Winter collection of
Christian Dior has really caught my attention. Design details, may it be covert or overt
are part and parcel of designer wear clothing. The detail congruence seen in this
collection resonated with me immensely. This is a creative perspective that I am truly
keen on integrating into my conceptualization in future collections. What is the biggest
lesson that you have learned since you started your company? While having a job, there
were times when I was disorganized and was able to get away with it. Having a label is
completely different. Being successful requires being rigorously organized. It is of
utmost importance. It was a real challenge at the start. Over time, I have learned to let
my creativity run wild and keep my workflow straight and narrow. Also, Fashion Design, as
fun as it is, is not a walk in the park. It's a multi-faceted discipline, which is
something most overlook. Understanding the vitality of being a perpetual student of thegame and striving to excel in every element of fashion design is another aspect that I
have learned since founding, “Dulasha”. What’s your motto? Passion manifests in the form
of perseverance. Which international or local designers are you inspired by? As mentioned
earlier, I make it a point to pay close attention to luxury designer brands such as Fendi,
Versace, Balenciaga, Gucci, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent (Saint Laurent) and
Christian Dior among many others. First and foremost, I am a fan and these brands have
done a grand job of making and keeping me a customer. This is a quality I aspire to
emulate. Alongside the brand loyalty which they induce, I also find inspiration in their
creative perspective. As I’ve said before I use my reality as a stimulant for my inner
subjective creativity. What role do you think social media plays in fashion today? “If a
large tree falls far away in a forest and there’s no one around, does it make a sound?”
Some think this has a complex answer, yet the fact is it’s quite simple: the impact will
create vibrations that no one will hear, and the sound is in the hearing of it. In the
same vein, one could have an outstanding brand with all the bells and whistles, yet
without substantial brand awareness, its impact will be negligible. In the current
landscape, social media, if utilized strategically, could be, a monumentally powerful tool
in your arsenal, on your path to success, however, you may perceive it. What is your
favourite part about being a designer? As an artist, I was able to manifest my imagination
in the form of a sketch or a painting. It’s such a joy to see what started as a figment of
your imagination take form on a canvas before you. It was not a thought anymore, it was
real. What got me hooked on fashion design was the promise that I could take it a
dimension further. As much as I love the design process, what I long the most for is to
try on the finished piece of clothing and to allow my senses to grasp how far a thought
has come. How do you want women to feel when wearing your clothes? As the tagline says, I
want everyone who wears my clothes to fall in love with themselves all over again. I am
dedicated to make this a reality. Striving to design clothes that induce confidence and
self-love is a pivotal element of the creative process. It's my vision to manifest an
enrichingly positive vibe through my brand which motivates my community and myself to
become the most beautiful version of ourselves, inside and out. PICS Courtesy: Dulasha

Jan 19 2021. Driven by a combination of a love for fashion and wanting to empower women
with her creations, Mandy Liyanage launched her brand Mandy Lee earlier this year. Using
social media to market her brand, Mandy’s collection is available online. A graduate in
Fashion and Textile design, Mandy opines that apart from academic qualifications there is
an element of self-learning in the realms of fashion. What sparked your interest in
fashion design? I have always been very passionate about designing fashion and I have been
consistently following international fashion trends to bring new ideas to the Sri Lankan
fashion industry with a twist of our own cultural element. What made you take fashion more
seriously and make a career out of it? I believe in first impressions and dressing well is
a form of good manners, therefore, fashion is more than just a passion to me. I always
wanted to pursue something that makes me truly happy. How has your work evolved since you
began your own label? We have been working tirelessly in order to proactively market our
products within the local community. We will continue to bring out a variety of designs
and hope to achieve our brand’s objectives soon. Where do you look for creative
inspiration? I proactively learn and get ideas from international fashion platforms. There
are so many talented local and international designers, I aspire to become more like them
with my own designs. Describe your latest collection? The theme of my latest collection is
'elegant and classy'. We have carefully designed this collection to exude simplicity
whilst preserving precision. Who is your muse? Victoria Beckham What are you fascinated by
at the moment and how does it feed into your work? As a designer, I review the works of
experts in the wider industry on a regular basis. I extract new ideas from their work and
blend them with our cultural delineation to create my own designs. What is the biggest
lesson that you have learned since you started your company? Take risks to seize
opportunities What’s your motto? The person who moves a mountain begins by carrying away
small stones. Which international or local designers are you inspired by? Alessandro
Michele, Nicolas Ghesquière and Stella McCartney What role do you think social media plays
in fashion today? Social Media has dominated the world of marketing. It definitely plays a
significant role in our clothing business journey as we predominantly market our products
via Instagram and Facebook. What is your favourite part about being a designer? If I had
to narrow it down, I would imagine it's the feeling of satisfaction I get by seeing my own
designs dominating the streets with elegance. How do you want women to feel when wearing
your clothes? Clothing magnifies confidence and therefore I want to empower women by
creating designs that bring out the best in them. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_21_Fashionably_Danu-_Featuring_LOVI.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu- Featuring LOVI
Jul 18 2017. Today on Fashionably Danu, I catch up with the man who made sarongs sexy
again - Asanka - about his newest collection. As a customer of LOVI, you will feel as
though you have the world at your feet. The new collection is bold and very rich and can
be a statement piece and the white ones are perfect for a High Tea or even a relaxing
Sunday Brunch. There is something about this brand that always makes you shine a bit more.
The collection is priced reasonably and available online to make life easy for us. Check
them out on: LOVISARONGS.COM FACEBOOK.COM/LOVISARONGS INSTAGRAM.COM/LOVISARONG We took
this week’s shoot to a new location, where LOVI will be available - the Design Collective
at Gandhara and the space was just breathtaking for a shoot. 1. What’s new with LOVI?
We’ve just released a new collection, available to order online at lovisarongs.com. You’ll
have to check out the bad boys and girls at LOVI to see. 2. Tell me about your collection
at Colombo Fashion Week? Our mission is to spread the thrill of sarongs, to define a new
Ceylonese look. The theme is “Modern Ceylon”. We’re bringing the sarong to the present, to
make it work with today’s active life. By adding pockets, for one. 3. What would you say
are the key features of the new collection? More pockets, gorgeous fabrics, and a rock
star attitude. We have created the world’s first sarong with pockets on both sides. 4.
LOVI has shirts and t-shirts, tell me about these creations? Yes, one of the biggest
requests we get from fans is how to wear LOVI sarongs. So we decided to make a few shirts,
t-shirts and tops to demonstrate the full LOVI sarong look. Make no mistake, we’re a
sarong company. We only make tops to show how sarongs could be worn proudly, elegantly. 5.
What other avenues would LOVI be branching out too? Our mission is to make sarongs feel
thrilling to wear. Innovate on the sarong itself. We’re a sarong company defining a bold
new Ceylonese look. 6. LOVI is also opening at the Gandhara Design Collective. Tell me
about what’s going to hit the shelves? We’re very excited! Congratulations to Shahili and
her team for the hard work in creating this beautiful shopping space. You’ll see our best.
A full collection, from tuxedo sarongs to rugby sarongs, and the new nautical line. 7.
Tell me about the collection I’m dressed in for this shoot? We showed these sarongs and
tops at Colombo Fashion Week this spring. The fabric has a beautiful shine. These sarongs
wrap and drape elegantly. They look sharp. You’d look like a million bucks wearing
them—though they cost much less, about Rs. 5,000 - Rs.9,000. 8. What is the process of
making a LOVI design? Hmmm, you want to know the secret? Well, maybe I can give you a
hint. We spend a lot of time in the idea and innovation phase before we pick a style to
build. That’s my favourite part actually. 9. Who do you envision wearing your work? Do you
think about this when you work on designs? Yes, very much. The leaders, visionaries, and
taste makers of Sri Lanka are already wearing LOVI. So we pay a lot of attention on how to
make them feel ‘loved in LOVI.’ 10. You guys were in the US. What was the feedback? They
noticed the stitching and fabric quality, which makes us proud. And the word about LOVI is
spreading fast thanks to our fans. People know us by name in the U.S. too, which feels
crazy. We’re very grateful to our fans. If you haven’t yet, join the bunch at

May 16 2017. Today, I feature one interesting product. I was fascinated to see a bow tie
made out of wood, and it even looked comfortable when I saw it on someone at a party, and
I had to feature it. The best part was that it was launched recently on May 6, which also
happened to be the designer's birthday. I chatted with Amry Ahamed, who is the brainchild
of this new brand. To make your orders, check the pages out on Facebook and Instagram .
Why bow ties? Finding men's accessories in Sri Lanka is a task, the traditional ties and
bow ties that are vastly available are the only options. I'd had the pleasure of owning a
wooden bow tie during my travels which caught my eye and immediately felt the need to
introduce it in Sri Lanka, not just importing it but making it in Sri Lanka with locally
sourced wood. What was the inspiration behind your brand? Friends and family around me
have always insisted that I have a good fashion sense. I take making a statement through
your choice of apparels and accessories very serious. During an event last year I wore a
wooden bow tie and everyone noticed it at first sight, which instantly gave me the idea to
introduce it to the local market. What's the story behind the name 'Amberry'? Amberry is a
nickname that has come to life eventually. A cousin of mine would call me that and said
that one day I could make it a brand, and here I am, many years later introducing Amberry
to Sri Lanka and the world. Your product is unique in comparison to what's available
locally. Tell us about what makes you stand out. The wooden bow tie concept is something
new to Sri Lanka. We initiated the first of its kind Sri Lankan made wooden bow tie. Each
product is handmade and unique on its own. Streamlining handpicked resources to fine tune
products. Is it only going to be about bow ties? We intend to reinvent men's accessories.
We will be expanding in to cufflinks, wooden ties, tie pins, belts and wooden eye wear.
How long did it take to master the first one you ever created? Introducing a product 100%
locally sourced and made has been a dream come true to me. I did a lot of research and
studied about the product. I was excited about getting the very first wooden bow tie done.
It took me about a month to put together and come up with the masterpiece. Who do you
envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? The vision
is reinventing men's accessories, at this point its catered to the general public of all
age groups. I see the product and brand taking flight when it's fully introduced to the
market with the ranges we provide. You ""Danu"" carried off the tie very elegantly I must
admit, I appreciated and loved the look you carried whilst wearing the bow ties. What are
some new pieces you are working on, and what are your plans for the future? The plan is to
work under the four ranges available for bow ties: Casual - Classic - Ceremonial and
Customized. Currently I am working on a couple of more bowtie designs and planning on
introducing our own range of wooden cufflinks too which would also be under the 4
categories. The plan for the future is for it to be available at selected stores, and duty
free magazines, and of course the brand going global. What prompted you to work on and
create an exclusive range for men? Will there be anything for women in the future? Finding
accessories for men in Sri Lanka is quite the challenge. Even the thought of picking up a
gift for a man is difficult. So it inspired me to introduce an exclusive range for men. We
might introduce an exclusive range of products for women in the future under a different
brand name. How would you describe a Sri Lankan man's fashion and style? Sri Lankans are
very conscious about their dress sense. Be it a woman or a man, there's a growing fashion
trend that everyone's joining in. I think we feel good about looking good and that says a
lot. Considering that we have an amazing platform such as Colombo Fashion Week which
launches new designers and brands all the time, it proves that Sri Lankan fashion is
actually hitting a new high. We shot at a fab location, and that’s Jetwing Colombo 7, and
speaking to the man behind the lens, this is what he had to say.. What are your thoughts
on the wooden bow tie collection? This is a very new concept for the Sri Lankan fashionmarket. I like it simply because of their trendy designs and durability. Do you see this
product doing well in our stores locally? Since this is very new to the Sri Lankan market,
the designer must market it so well that it will become a fashion symbol to wear. Since
bowties are in trend now, this might be a big hit. What were you hoping to achieve in
terms of the shoot? We gave it a vibrant look with mostly closeup shots since I wanted to
highlight the product. Jetwing Colombo 7 was the perfect setting for the shoot. Designer -

life_fashion90_21_Fashionably_Danu_-_Double_XL.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu - Double XL
Nov 07 2017. Today I embrace my curves with Double XL, a place where you are not judged.
Adhisha has worked with cotton and linen to rock this collection for me, and you can see
this on their shelves soon. Adhisha who herself has battled with weight issues says
clothing should make you feel good, no matter what your size is. I loved wearing this
collection and I paired some with my favorite LOVI Sarongs to give an island look! Why the
name Double XL? How was it received when you first introduced your brand? The concept of
the store was to cater to the ""plus-size"" populace in Sri Lanka. The brand name ‘'Double
XL'' surprisingly was an overnight hit and fortunately for us, it was well received by our
clients. It ended up being rather quite a sensation among this target market eventually.
Tell me about your collection which you have featured in this shoot? I have managed to
pick some of the latest trends globally and come up with a collection that is stylish yet
simple for our gentlemen. This shoot will feature an array of men’s clothing, evening and
casual wear using cotton and linen fabrics with a tie and dye and batik ornamentation.
What would you say is missing in men’s fashion in Sri Lanka? I find men's fashion,
especially in Sri Lanka to be rather monotonous. Only a few brave men will go that extra
mile to take that risk and put together something quite exquisite. As Yves Saint Laurent
once went on to say, ""Fashions fade, style is eternal"". I am a firm believer in this! As a
brand, how many pieces do you put out in every collection? Do you also custom-make? In
general terms, we produce 5 pieces each from a design. Our sizes range from XL to 7XL. We
have a talented pool of in-house designers so yes; we do consider bespoke clothing. I
don't see a reason why we shouldn't! Tell me the story, what made you start this? I
personally believe that all of us should eat right, dress right and it is an impetus to
maintain a healthy lifestyle. But being plus-size I truly understood the pain and agony
our plus-size friends endured on a daily basis especially to find suitable clothing that
is comfortable yet stylish. In this ever-changing world, ''change'' being inevitable, we
have to realise that all of us go through body transformations with time. However, it is
quite important for one to feel comfortable yet stand out during all these stages. This
was what gave birth to Double XL. Would you get into regular-sized clothing? We at Double
XL have been fortunate enough to build a strong brand identity over the past couple of
years. Over the years, we have evolved into an exclusive plus-size boutique store. So, no
we wish to continue to cater to this target market. Would you be going online soon? We
already have looked into this option, although we believe that our clients are more
comfortable when they wear the merchandise and are able to experience sheer happiness with
a perfect fit, body type and shape as plus-size clothing is very tricky and the fit
depends on body types. What is the process of creating and marketing your design? Your
design inspiration? Our designers work tirelessly to achieve an end product that is in
line with the global fashion trends but yet is comfortable. Hence importance is given to
fabric types, fabrication, body fit, body type, colour and design to achieve the said.
This is our passion. There is no greater feeling than to provide our clients with what
they expect, not only in comfort but also in quality and a perfect fit. Who do you
envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? I am
dedicated to serve plus-size individuals as myself as I, personally am aware what they
require in terms of fashion, comfort and fit. What would you say are five important items
which need to be in any man's wardrobe? I would include the following: Shirts - Both long
and short sleeve Pants - Denim and cotton T-shirts - Both polo and crew necks Shorts -
Including three quarters Comfortable underwear Designer – Adhisha Dahanayake Photographer

life_fashion90_21_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring__-_Four_in_Hand.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - Four in Hand
Dec 06 2017. 1. In your opinion how many ties should a man own? Everyone’s gotta have a
plain-coloured conventional tie, but remember to contrast it with your shirt. Number 2 - A
cropped knitted tie. You can play it safe with a stripe or check, or muster up some
courage to pull off a floral or paisley. I say you muster up some courage. If anyone asked
me how many they should own I’d say these three could cover a lot of ground. 2. You have
come up with a seasonal collection, tell me about it? Inspired by the season. Reds,
greens, reindeer. I tried to incorporate the knitted tie into the Christmas theme which I
don’t think people here have ever seen and it’s honestly been such a hit. 3. What are the
ties you have featured on me today? They’re a lot more flamboyant than the ties we
showcased earlier. Brighter colours and bolder designs. It’s the stuff I want local men to
kind of take a chance on and wear with confidence. Much like how you wear most of your
outfits. I hope that when they see these ties on you that it’ll inspire them to step
outside their comfort zone a little in terms of dress sense. 4. You are going to be at the
pop-up Christmas sale, what's going to be out for sale? Everything's gonna be there. The
new and the old and in large quantities. It'll be the most dapper sale of the year. And
we've got some sick deals lined up with a couple of other emerging brands. It's the one
stop for your male Christmas gifts. It won't be just ties ; it'll be the whole range of
men's accessories and menswear. 5. How ready are the men of Sri Lanka for some bold ties
with some floral prints? The men of Sri Lanka are a tough clan to conquer. A lot of us are
not so welcoming to change. So for those of us that have been stuck in the ways of plain
colours and conventional dressing, it's a tough ask to make a sudden switch to bolder
prints. But that's what makes my job interesting. I need to find a way to convince the
disbelievers, and get them to give these new looks a try. Four In Hand has managed to do a
lot better than I expected and it's convinced quite a few people to be courageous and take
a chance. The thing I love about Sri Lankan men though is their loyalty to what they
believe. Once convinced, they'll stand by you until given a reason not to. 6. Tell me
about the bow tie collection and the different materials you use? We do the conventional
bow ties, with cotton wool and polyester. A new addition to our line is the knitted bow
tie! I'm super excited about this piece because it's something like the knitted tie, out
of the ordinary but super cool. 7. Can you also customize designs on request? Well, that's
still in discussion within the team. It depends on where we want to be in the future.
Whether we want to be a fashion label that inspires people? Or a manufacturing company? I
want to be able to inspire people through our selection of products and offering a little
customization on top of that is a definite yes in the future. But letting the public
entirely produce their own designs is probably not something we want to get into. Not now
and not under the brand Four In Hand. 8. What makes your ties different? What has been the
reception for bold prints? I love the way people feel when they try something new and they
realise the outcome is positive. That's what the tie is about and how's it's different
from just buying any regular tie. It unconsciously teaches people to step a little outside
their comfort zone and thrive in those situations. I feel this helps people develop a lot
more maturity not only with their dress sense but the way they tackle life in general. If
you want to touch, feel and buy the ties, you can at “The All I Want for Christmas” -

life_fashion90_21_Wedding_Fashion_Reimagined.pdf,"Wedding Fashion Reimagined
Feb 16 2021. In a unique collaboration with industry stakeholders across the board,
Founder and CEO of Lovi Ceylon, Asanka de Mel recently launched the LOVI Ceylon’s Groom
collection. Each groom’s look was paired with extraordinary creations from Sri Lanka’s top
bridal designers, jewellers, florists, hair and make-up artists and was captured by story-
telling photographers. “Together we’re creating moments of happiness and cherished
memories for the new couple and their families,” said de Mel. Explaining the rationale
behind the collaborative effort, de Mel stated: “we want our Groom and all of the men in
the wedding including the groomsmen, dads, young boys and friends, to be themselves--to
feel rooted in culture, well dressed and at ease on the wedding day.” Celebrating the
religious and cultural traditions including Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Kandyan, Malay,
Muslim, Sinhala, Tamil and western traditions of the island LOVI Ceylon’s Grooms' range
presented modern sarongs paired with formal shirts, jackets, kurtas and more. They were
paired with sarees, dresses, lehengas, pantsuits and an array of breathtaking outfits
painstakingly made by renowned designers Dhananjaya Bandara, Rishard Raheem, and Michael
Wijesuriya as well as Indi Yapa Abeywardena of Brides by INDI, Sonali Dharmawardena,
Darshi Keerthisena of Buddhi Batiks, Ramona Oshini, Sandani Perera of IKIGAI Bridal, and
Jaish Parathalingam of Aashkii. Realising a lifelong dream of creating bridalwear Anusha
David also presented her couture creations under the label, Gabriel. Photographed over
three days at the Taj Samudra and Shangri-La hotels the father-son duo of Dinuka and
Dineth Fonseka of Studio3000 captured some stunning images as the anchor photography
partner. The works of Ashene Bernard, Amarante Studio, Geeshan Bandara, and Portrait
Culture were also presented in imaginative and artistic captures. Over 30 leading
designers from across the board worked hand in hand to infuse fresh ideas, celebrate
cultural diversity and show-off Sri Lankan couture using the island’s handcraft heritage.
Lovi along with the bridal designers offered many looks for the Sri Lankan diaspora, as
well as couples seeking inspiration for destination weddings. As the designs progressed
from sketch to stitching, jewellers such as Careems, Lalitha, Mallika Hemachandra, Tiesh
and Vogue jewellers completed the outfits with handcrafted fine jewellery made of precious
metals encrusted with diamonds, sapphires and rubies. Adding to the beauty were the latest
floral creations by Designer Flowers, Flowers by Joan and Karen Forbes, Lassana Flora, and
Supreme Flora. Playing a pivotal role in adding beauty to the brides were Nadiya Fernando
and her collaborator Omesh Wijeratne who were the hair and make-up anchors of the shoot
while Ramani Fernando Salons, Shane Perera, Viran Peter, Brides by Leena and Talia
designs, also worked their magic on the models who were from Brian Kerkoven and The
Agency. Adding an interesting dimension over the two days was poet and author Ashok Ferry
who cut a dashing figure clad in Lovi while providing an eloquent commentary as MC of the
shoot. Speaking further on this unique collaboration, de Mel also stated “we have world-
class craftsmanship here, it’s fun to work with so many experts, who just happen to be
friends, to present a beautiful collection that could nudge the course of Sri Lankan
clothing identity” said Asanka when asked about the work that went into this.” Of his
collection for grooms, he rightly reminded the gentlemen to choose wisely, ""on that
special wedding day, when all eyes are on her--her eyes are on you!"". Tina Edward

after becoming a mother, I wanted a creative outlet that I can also earn an income from by
staying at home so jewellery making seemed the perfect fit for what I wanted to do. Are
you self-taught or did you study jewellery design? I am self-taught. How has your work
evolved since you began your own label? Now I try to create collections rather than one-
off designs (though I still do this when inspiration hits). While I create more classic,
timeless pieces, I try to incorporate trends into these designs rather than be wholly
focused on trends. Are there any types of jewellery that you avoid designing? I try not to
do a lot of beading work as it is time-consuming. Being a stay-at-home mom in this season
with homeschool going on, I need to be wise on how I utilize my time. Where do you look
for creative inspiration? My family and friends and their personalities are my
inspiration. For example, my daughter loves jewellery so I made a range of children’s
jewellery. I have friends who have boho and minimal tastes so there is a lot of jewellery
that swings back and forth from these styles. I had a friend who needed a maang tikka in a
modern design so I incorporated that into my bridal range. Describe your latest
collection? Pearls, pearls and pearls from shell pearls to baroque pearls. For those who
love elegance as well as boho chic. Who is your muse? No one in particular... I am quite
eclectic in my tastes. So I am inspired by a lot of people, not one in particular. What
are your sustainability credentials? I try to focus on creating an ethical business to the
best of my ability. I don’t look for cheap supplies but buy my supplies from small
businesses like mine. I also use materials that last longer and can be replated. I keep my
packaging sustainable. Everything needs to be reusable. What are you fascinated by at the
moment and how does it feed into your work? Fascinated with baroque pearls, raw stones,
crystals ... My collections seem to reflect it. What is the biggest lesson that you have
learned since you started your company? Know when you need to work smart and know when you
need to work hard. How did you scale your business during covid-19? Taking it slow
currently and focusing on family, trying to sustain it at the moment so doing not just
handmade items but curated jewellery too. I am also looking at future opportunities to
grow and prepare for it. What’s your motto? Trust in god. Which international or local
designers are you inspired by? Hmmm, I am not sure... I tend to follow the beat of my own
drums. So I tend to be more inspired by smaller designers doing their own thing. What role
do you think social media plays in fashion today? Quite a big role actually in terms of
inspiring and motivating people to buy. It also gives people access to a wide range of
choices and that evens out things for small businesses like mine. What is your favourite
part about being a designer? Staying at home... I am really lucky to have a business I can
adapt to fit me. How do you want women to feel when wearing your jewellery? Confident and
beautiful. I would like to think that my jewellery enhances someone’s beauty rather than
being the focal part of it. It brings a smile to my face really when people send me
pictures of themselves wearing my jewellery. I don’t really consider myself a designer, I
started making jewellery quite late in life. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_22_Designer_1-2-1_Terin_Gabbalage.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Terin Gabbalage
Sep 25 2018. The founder of Wedding Dreams and TERIN, Designer Terin began her journey as
a designer 14 years ago. Hers was the first store creating bridal dresses and spotting a
demand for glamorous evening-wear she started Evening wear by TERIN. Her specialty is
creating luxury bridal dresses and evening wear for discerning brides and those seeking a
glamorous gown for a special occasion. What made you embark on a career in fashion design
? I’ve always been a creative being and developed a love for fashion and textiles from a
very young age. The sense of achievement I get when I transform a design on a paper to an
actual garment is one of the main reasons that made me choose designing as a career. What
is your latest collection called? My collection for Wedding Dreams is called 'White
Bridals' while the collection for 'Evening wear by TERIN' is called ""Bejeweled"" Do you
specialize in wedding or evening dresses? I started off my career with bridals and started
designing evening dresses due to many requests I received from my clients. Due to the
positive feedback and demand, I decided to launch my second label ' Evening wear by
TERIN', so now I specialize both in bridals and evening dresses. What inspired this
collection? My collection “White bridals” is inspired by the innocence and purity of a
woman. The collection consists of subtle hues and tastefully embelished gowns with simple,
classic cut dresses. Luxurious fabrics with a dull luster, delicate and shimmering
embellishments and sculpted sheaths add a soft romantic feel to the collection. My evening
wear collection, 'bejeweled' is inspired by the beautiful varieties of gems found in Sri
Lanka. The collection consists of exquisite crystal embellishments and fine silks. Shiny
golden and silver thread work are the signature looks which add glamor and elegance to the
collection. What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri Lanka?
When I launched my label ‘Wedding Dreams’14 years ago it was the only bridal dress store
in Sri Lanka and back then convincing Sri Lankan brides to wear a dress on their big day
was a bit of a challenge. This has changed over the past 14 years. In general rising cost
of manufacturing garments is a huge challenge currently. With the increasing cost of
living clients tend to look for low budget options, which in turn constricts designers
from creating unique extra-ordinary pieces which obviously costs more. I think this is a
major drawback for the creative aspect of a fashion business. Where do you retail your
stuff? I retail my bridals and evening wear at Wedding Dreams, but my evening wear is also
available online. What is your top tip when selecting a cocktail or wedding dress? You
should always be aware of what your body type is, and you should accept the fact that all
silhouettes will not suit you. If any of my clients are getting a dress designed and
custom-made by me I always encourage them to first try on a dress with a similar cut, so
she could see for herself how it looks on her. Just because a dress looks nice in a
magazine or Pinterest that does not mean it will be the most stunning silhouette for you.
Who is your muse? My muse is not an individual. My muse is my clients, the women around
me. Fashion prediction for next season? In terms of silhouettes, crop tops, will still be
in, while cape sleeves and cold shoulders will make a strong comeback as it was repeatedly
seen in many collections. There was a strong Victorian influence, so we’ll be seeing lots
of ruffles, lace and broaches. Velvet, silks, sequined and metallic foil fabrics will be a
top trend in the next season. Who would you like seeing dressed in your creations? I do
not have a specific celebrity or a famous person in mind, though it would be great to see
someone famous wearing my label . however I still get excited when I see clients wearing
my dresses. How do you balance creativity with commerce? It’s important to understand the
client's buying power, so I always work around a budget. If it’s a custom-made garment I
inquire about the budget first and work around it because no matter how fabulous the
design is, if the client can’t afford it, I will not be able to get the product sold. I
talk to my clients to find the correct balance between my creativity and the commercialappeal of my products in order to drive sales. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_22_Emerging_Designers_at_CFW.pdf,"Emerging Designers at CFW
Feb 27 2024. One of the biggest draws of Colombo Fashion Week is the day when emerging
designers showcase their collections. This is my particularly favourite segment as
designers with potential are given a platform to showcase their collections and patrons
get to see what the future holds for Sri Lankan design. CFW’s Designer Development
Programme which began since the inception of CFW over two decades ago is a multi-pronged
system where CFW selects a tranche of young designers who they mentor in design and
retail. They also help train them and showcase their designs in addition to providing
opportunities for funding with the CFW Accelerate and the Italy Design Award. Today over
90% of the designers in Sri Lanka are products of this platform initiated by CFW. Fazeena
Rajabdeen, Director and Chief Executive Officer of CFW has personally overseen the
development programme for the young designers. “This year we received 62 applications of
which 22 were short-listed and there will be over 11 designers who will showcase on the
6th” she said. “These young designers not only get an opportunity to showcase their
collections at CFW but we help them with retail opportunities during the event and after
that with well-known retailers in the city” she added. Explaining the process, Fazeena
said “The criteria we employ to select the designer is primarily based on the designer’s
passion to be in the industry and they need to have a keen focus in design. They come to
us and we develop and nurture them. They need to have a passion to be in the industry and
a background knowledge and a degree in design are a value in addition. We also need them
to have a commitment and a desire to grow the brand. The designers we select have to
commit to three years to see the brand through as building brands is not only creating a
line of clothing but the need to have the business acumen to see the brand through.”
“Every season they bring in senior designers to be a part of the mentorship panel. This
time Sharmila Ruberu from the brand Meraki has been involved in the nurturing process of
the designers. She has been on board with the current crop of designers and helped them
throughout imparting valuable information and guiding them through the process” she added.
Designer Sharmila Ruberu explained that she was honoured to be called upon to mentor the
students. “It has been such a brilliant time working with this crop of young designers.
They are brimming with ideas and enthusiasm. They have a real thirst to learn and also to
improve what they came to us with. I believe that with young designers like this, the
future of design in Sri Lanka augurs well. They are also keen to highlight heritage crafts
such as batik, handloom, embroidery and weaving which they have incorporated into their
collections” “The Emerging Designer platform has been gaining momentum year on year.
However, right after the economic crisis, we saw a decline in applications which was sad
as it shows the creative industry did not see the potential for fashion on the island.
However, this time we have received a large number of applications which goes to show that
the creative industry is picking up and the trend is reversing. This is very promising for
the industry as it shows that the young designers have regained their faith in the
progression of the fashion industry in Sri Lanka” she further explained. “We encourage the
junior designers to be part of the responsible meter and sustainable platform which is one
of the core pillars of CFW. Having designers who will be a part of this from the inception
creates brands that are responsible in nature and are aligned to the value system
described by the responsible meter. This places emphasis on sustainable fabrics increases
the use and exposure of Sri Lankan crafts and creates a social impact. At the forthcoming
show guests can look forward to young vibrant and novel designers whose inspiration and
design are fresh and imaginative,” she said. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_22_Street_Style-_Anuradha.pdf,"Street Style- Anuradha
Oct 17 2017. An HR professional in Colombo, Anuradha defines her style in three words;
Feminine, Sleek and Dapper. “I like to dress in formal with a well groomed touch to it and
I’m a big fan of drip-dry materials!” “I just love to go for a simple and more natural
look.” This week on Street Style, we discover what style means to Anuradha. Gym Look Today
everyone has a sense of fitness. I love starting my day early in the morning with some
cardio and ab workouts. For this I have a clingy outfit that is a grass green Nike dry fit
top with multicoloured tights and New Balance 520V2 running shoes accessorized by Spy+
polarized shades. Official Look For a corporate look I use the trendy off-shoulder pattern
which I’m crazy about. This is a pearl white chiffon dress with a mod circle necklace
paired with an Old Navy leather handbag accompanied by watermelon pink sunglasses and
peach coloured pointed-toe pumps. This whole outfit has a diverse range of colour and I
love it! Night Out Look For a casual night out when I’m relaxing, I always look for
something comfortable. This is a deep black cotton dress paired with gold sandals and for
accessories I’ve only used an Omax silver gold watch because I really believe that plain
and simple gives an elegant touch. Evening Wear Occasionally, I wear a Saree for weddings.
This is a smooth glossy silky two toned saree with a heavy boarder paired with a rose gold
peep- toe platform. I’ve accessorized with a simple customized wired necklace. Casual Look
I wore this off shoulder maxi dress with long slit. This is a close - fitting dress with
dull and bright colours together. I’ve accessorized with Dior sunglasses and gold colour
slip on shoes together with pigtails and the Kitty Cat Ear band. This overall outfit is
perfect to wear on vacation. Style Role Model: My style icons would be Emma Watson,
Leighton Meester, Audrey Hepburn, and currently Selena Gomez . Each woman has/had timeless
style and is/was very feminine about how they dressed. My style pulls inspiration from
each one of these icons. Favourite Colours to Pair: Because I’m a huge colour fan, I love
luminous colours. I like blue, green, pink and purple a lot. Go To Outfit: I like to be
comfortable so a short dress with silver or gold sandals is perfect. Style Must Have’s? I
feel a watch is a must because it gives the formal look even for a casual look. Various
shades in different colours and the patterns. Have a simple touch with matte lipstick.
Make-up Tips? If you can use matte products it will add more glamour than the glossy
products. Turn a pencil eyeliner into a gel formula with the help of a match or lighter.
Style No’s: Never wear pants that don’t fit Leggings and sweatpants are not for fashion
wear. Avoid horizontal stripes like the plague Too much accessories Too much make ups Ill-
fitting dresses Style Tip: Cuff your jeans: Cuffs on skinny jeans look best on the smaller
side, because they keep the streamlined look of the fitted pants. Make the cuffs about a
half-inch wide and only roll them twice. Cinch a shapeless dress: some ill-fitting dresses
hides your shape and can look like it came from your mom’s closet. So try to get a clingy
dress instead. Use less jewellery with simple patterns. It will give you extra detailed
elegance. Law Graduate, food and travel enthusiast and full time dog mom.. Your comment

model per se but I do admire certain artists such as Rihanna, Beyonce and many urban
artistes. Favourite Colours to Pair? I love bold, vibrant solid colours! I’m a big fan of
colours like pink, orange and purple. Go To Outfit? Shorts and a top! Style Must Haves?
Black shorts. It goes with everything Style Tip? Can't go wrong as long as you have a
black dress Style Nos? I don't really have any style Nos. I believe that everyone should

life_fashion90_22_The_Gorgeous_Jetsetter.pdf,"The Gorgeous Jetsetter
Mar 13 2018. Could you give us a little introduction to yourself? My name is Darni
Alweera, I am 30 years old and I currently live in Australia. I’m completing a Bachelor’s
Degree in Business full-time majoring in Marketing while working on blogging and social
media full-time as well. My blog name is www.darni.net. I also do modelling , acting,
promotional and hospitality work part-time. On top of that, I do boxing and weight
training 3 to 4 times a week as it’s is one of my huge priorities, not only to keep fit
and healthy but also it helps immensely to battle stress, which I struggle with due to
juggling a busy lifestyle. 2) Where did you interest in style develop and how would you
describe your style? I have always been into fashion but I think I got more adventurous
once I reached my early twenties. I think older I got, less I cared about what people
thought. Fortunately, a lot of people actually fancy my style haha! I like to think my
fashion is ageless and what I wear purely depends on my mood. My style is very personal
and broad, and I don’t think I can class it in any way. I find anything from what my mum
used to wear to what Bella Hadid wears fascinating. Some items in my wardrobe have been in
there for years. I also hate fast fashion and how mass textile waste is impacting the
environment. You will see on my blog that I reuse old clothing from my wardrobe with new
stuff and create brand new looks often. How I value my clothes is not on the price tag but
how it makes me look and feel. My favourite pair of pants is a pair of high waisted denim
flare pants I got from H&M and they cost me $5. Every single time I wear them at least one
person pays me a compliment. I’m not sure who said this but I love the quote ‘Don’t change
to fit the fashion. Change the fashion to fit you’. It resonates with me every day when I
create my looks. 3) What has been the highlight of your work life? I guess one of the
proudest moments in my work life would be joining Emirates as an air hostess. Being an air
hostess was my dream job. As a little girl, I was infatuated with how amazing air
hostesses looked, their lifestyle and the idea of travelling so much. When I was only 20
Emirates came to Colombo to recruit cabin crew. They had ceased recruiting in Sri Lanka
for many years due to the war. A person has to be at least 21 to be employed in the UAE
(where Emirates Airlines is based) and the chances of me getting in were super slim. On
the open day, there were about a thousand people there. Most were already cabin crew with
Sri Lankan airlines with years of experience. I wasn’t even old enough and had no
experience, a few people were like ‘what are you even doing here? They would not even
consider you’ But I got through. I got my hair and nails done, did my resume, did so much
of research on airlines, how to answer the one on one questions and I felt as ready as I
could be, and got through! 4) What are your dreams for the future? My dreams evolve and
change as I grow. But I guess I have a few things I want to achieve within the next 10
years. I would love to create my own brand. I’m still searching within me on what really
resonates with me but I can see a clothing brand of my own. At the same time if I could
create jobs in Sri Lanka in the process that would be amazing. There is so much talent in
Sri Lanka that is in need of a little helping hand to succeed and thrive. The end goal
would be to have a passive income so I am able to enjoy life to the fullest with my loved
ones. For the full interview please visit http://www.theliyareina.com By: Gayanthi

life_fashion90_22_Why_Is_Makeup_Important.pdf,"Why Is Makeup Important?
I like to share a totally different perspective in makeup and hope my point is accepted in
good spirit. Recently when I tried to educate my very young niece who was starting to
embark on wearing makeup, I found my own grownup daughter shutting me up as if I didn't
know what I was talking about. Failing that attempt to explain myself, I like to share my
thoughts on this post. Please don't take me wrong, I love the beauty of the illusions
created by makeup due to the fantasy that can take the minds of an audience even for a
moment. The flip side is that unless women wear makeup 24x7, the illusion can somewhat
become a “trick” on those trying to get to know her. The flip side of the argument is that
women wear makeup mostly to look & feel good for themselves without the intent to deceit,
then in such a case, I consider the woman may need psychological help more than makeup in
order to feel good about her. I believe most people do their best to minimize or refrain
from using shampoo or other toxic ingredients and I myself only use conditioner when I
shower to reduce the chemical effect on my body even though I wish I can only use fresh
lime and a non-toxic soap. But I cannot imagine how far most women are willing to go (ex:
Nicki Minaj) to change their total outlook by plastering layers of various chemically
toxic makeup on one of their most valuable parts of the body: the face. Knowing the damage
the toxicity causes, women are compelled to wash off the makeup at least before going to
bed while that can create almost a double appearance on their most intimate partner. It is
one thing for a public performer be it a circus clown, Beyoncé or Nicki Minaj to mask
their faces with makeup to portray a different image but for the rest of us who doesn’t
have such a livelihood/need, I believe we all enjoy seeing the natural beauty of anything,
including women,",1903

Favorite Colors - Black, red and white Today on buzz, I chat with Christina Peiris who
will represent Sri Lanka at the upcoming Miss Universe 2017 pageant in Las Vegas, Nevada.
we Had her on my radio show after she won her crown, and what’s amazing is how simple and
fun loving she is, not forgetting her beauty. so i’m happy to say that Sri Lanka has a
strong chance of winning the BIG crown this year. What made you become a social media
influencer? Is it fun? What do you hope accomplish? It all started through my Instagram
account, I never thought that I would be a social media influencer one day. It all began
after I posted travel photos and received positive feedback from my followers. It was then
I decided to link my Instagram to an actual blog and it’s turned in to one of my passions
ever since. I mainly focus on promoting tourism in Sri Lanka, cafes, restaurant, hotels
and beautiful places I come across. I also write about my international journeys because I
want to share my experience with everyone. I hope to promote more tourism in our country
through my blog in the future. You have been working with the Cancer hospital for a long
time, tell me what’s the inspiration? After losing a number of family members to cancer
I’ve had my fair share of spending time in the cancer home in Maharagama and getting to
know other patient’s stories and their families. Since launching my clothing brand X.TINA
I’ve always wanted to contribute to a cause that had a big impact on my life, because I
wanted to give back to our community. It’s been only 8 months since I launched my clothing
brand and at the end of every year a percent of the profits are donated to the cancer
home. On a visit last month to inquire what they needed the most through donations they
informed us that dry rations were no shortage and toys for the children were very limited
as they cannot play with any fabricated toys and certain types of plastic. Donations in
the form of medication was what they needed the most to increase the life span of the
patients. When I am back after the Miss Universe Pageant I will be donating the medication
they require before Christmas. Who has been the biggest support in your life? My family
would have to get most of the credit if not all for everything they do to help and support
me. Constant motivation and guidance from them has helped me through out all these years.
I’m blessed with a family who believes in me and everything I want to achieve in life.
Tell me your style of work? When it comes to my blog, brand or now being Miss Universe Sri
Lanka I have three separate styles in the way I work. I think it’s important to be
versatile but stay true to who you are. It’s very important to me that I am able to
incorporate different techniques and styles in order to show the diversity in me. What
would you say, is the biggest challenge people face in Sri Lanka, and what impact do you
hope to make with your crown? Sri Lanka is a country which had a war for 30 years. I would
like to focus on people who seldom have access to public areas. For kids and adults who
are less abled whether by birth, injury or sickness. It is sad that buildings in Sri Lanka
do not facilitate less abled people and wheelchairs. I would like to focus on making
disabled access mandatory in public building and bring awareness to the authorities. What
are some of your most defining moments in life? December 2016 when I launched my blog,
April 2017 the launch of my clothing brand and October 2017 when I was crowned Miss
Universe Sri Lanka 2017. Tell me about your design label? And what you hope to design for
the international pageant? After completing my degree in fashion design I was able to
launch my clothing brand a year later. X.TINA is a humanitarian clothing brand where I
hope to donated medication to the cancer home at the end of every year through a
percentage of my profits. I do a lot of batiks and casual wear at the moment so when I
took on designing two evening gowns to take with me for the pageant I was excited as I was
working with wedding dreams on both dresses. I wanted to keep the silhouettes fitted,sultry and timeless, as I want to look back at these photographs years from now still
loving what I wore 10 years ago. I think the key is to be timeless and you can never go
wrong. How is it to be crowned as a beauty queen of Sri Lanka? It’s been a lot of
responsibility and it hasn’t sunk in yet because I’ve been doing everything I can to
prepare for the international pageant. After my crowning I only had slightly over three
weeks so I haven’t had the opportunity to feel like Miss Universe Sri Lanka yet as I’m so
engrossed with preparing for Las Vegas. However, after I was crowned I received an
enormous amount of love and support from not only Sri Lanka but from people around the
world as well which has also helped in keeping me motivated for the upcoming pageant. What
has been your favourite travel destination and why? Greece, specifically Santorini.
Without a doubt it is truly heaven on earth. Traveling and exploring other countries has
been a family hobby from a very young age. We would all have multiple opinions on the
countries we visited and Santorini was a place we all agreed on and hope to visit again
soon. The locals go out of their way to help you, they are so welcoming and kind which
makes your experience a million times better. Theres not a bad picture you could take in
Santorini, every corner and turn you take is picture perfect. Greek food and music are
also bonus points! In the spot... What are your thoughts on the rise in the suicide level?
Growning up hearing about constant suicides had an impact on my life to be there for
people more. I think one of the main problems with suicide is that no one pays attention
when someone needs help emotionally. No one takes someone seriously when they say that
they are depressed or having thoughts about taking their own life. People need to
encourage people to seek help when they notice that someone is no longer the same,
mentally. People need to start being there for each other. What do you say is the biggest
issue that the youth faces today in Sri Lanka? Diversity and stereotypes. For many years
the youth in Sri Lanka have had to deal with the stereotypical image people have set upon
us. Up to date many are not able to go after their actual dreams and passions because
their parents don’t see it as being a valid qualification or it simply won’t impress
relatives or society. Many youngsters are unhappy or are confused with that they want to
achieve or do in the future because of restrictions set upon them by parents. Just for
Fun... Who was your favourite teacher and why? Mr. Seki was my biology teacher in the
Cambridge High School, Abu Dhabi. I never had a great student teacher bond when I was
schooling in Sri Lanka. Mr. Seki was the first teacher I met when I joined high school
after I moved to Abu Dhabi. He is South African and full of energy and compassion towards
his students. What makes you feel the most secure? Knowing that my family is right beside
me. I couldn’t have done most of it without their constant help and positivity. Who do you
admire the most? I admire my father the most. My parents have always been my role models
and heroes and I couldn’t admire someone I do not know and don’t look up to. After losing
my mother to Cancer at the age of 13 my father took on both roles of being both parents
and he did a fantastic job with it. I admire the way he puts his job on hold for my sister
and I, how he takes a flight to see us if one of us isn’t feeling well. He’s always made
us his priority and put his life on hold for the two of us. I hope that when I have
children one day that I am able to support them the way my father does. Have you ever had
a reoccurring dream? What was it? I have multiple reoccurring dreams, it’s either about
this huge white roman looking castle where I constantly see tall roman pillars. Lately
I’ve been dreaming about snakes which is a nightmare in my case and about the pageant.
Maybe because the pageant is constantly in my head but it’s never a good dream. I’ve
either forgotten my evening gown or missed my flight. Maybe these are signs from God to
pack early and leave on time. What was your nickname growing up, or now? I’ve had multiple
nicknames growing up and I’ll tell you exactly what they are including the strange ones as
well. Fasten your seatbelt, Chrissie, Chris, Tina, Platy, Grasshopper, Cactus, Plate and
Christo. Chrissy is the one that stuck from the time I was born until today. I need tothank my father for it. Who was your hero when you were a child, and what did you do to be
like them? My mother was my hero and still is until this day. Growing up I watched her
conquer her day being strong, confident, persistence, hardworking and on top of it all an
amazing mother. She took care of my sister and I while doing a full time job and still
made us the best dishes at the end of the day, made sure our school work was done and
still took us to all those birthday parties. I don’t know where she found the time to
juggle so much and still do a fantastic job. I hold her qualities close to heart and hope
that I am half the woman she was. A part of me is so hardworking because I want t o live
up to the standard she made as a mother and woman. If you had your own talk show, who
would your first three guests be? It would definitely be three of our main sponsors,
Revlon Pvt Ltd, Fine Jewellery Company and Indian Oil Corporation. I would definitely
start off my talk show by thanking them because if it wasn’t for their support I wouldn’t
have been able to have a talk show after being crowned Miss Universe Sri Lanka. If you
could live in any sitcom, which one would it be? FRIENDS! I could watch friends all over
again, even though I’ve seen every season multiple times. I could laugh for the same
episodes over and over and it never gets old. It’s one series where I fell in love with
all the characters and their personalities. If you could have been told one thing that you
weren’t told when you were a teenager, what would you like to have heard? Be patient and
keeping working hard, good things are definitely coming. If a movie was being made of your
life and you could choose the actress to play you, who would you choose and why? I have
always thought of making a movie or tv series of my life because I have no doubt that it
would inspire so many young girls out there. Freida Pinto crossed my mind because she is
raw, emotional and a great actress. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a Marketing qualification
(only because he needed to study, and not because he wanted it). He has been a part of the
team for seven years and is the face behind Buzz with Danu, and WTF. Your comment (*)",11018
life_fashion90_23_Designer_1-2-1-_Upeksha_Hager.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1- Upeksha Hager
Nov 27 2017. Injecting a feminine vibe into her creations, designer Upeksha Hager's
creations are unique. Soft drapes, flattering silhouettes, and complementary colours are
her hallmarks. As a designer, Upeksha is quick off the mark to know exactly what her
customer wants, this has held her in good stead in the industry, making her label U by
Upeksha a “go to” for women with a certain je ne sais quoi! What made you embark on a
career in fashion? I always had a sense about clothes, the fit, the feel, the mood of
them, and used to wear my own designs as a teenager. I studied Costume Design and worked
in theatre for a while. Once we moved to Sri Lanka, it felt natural to pick up fashion as
a career. What is your latest collection called? ‘Sunkissed' and 'Essential You' Describe
this new collection? Two easy-breezy collections with a certain delicateness coupled with
a surprise element. It’s the kind of clothes that make you shine before the dress. It fits
just right and it becomes you. They are all made of natural fabric. How long have you been
a designer for? 10 years in fashion design. What inspired this collection? It was an
abstract idea that came to mind as a pattern, a cool silhouette of a dress that overlaps
in the back and a loose fit. Then I explored it and I was inundated with many ideas that
made it possible to make the collection. What are the challenging aspects of running a
fashion business in Sri Lanka? Quality production capacity is my biggest challenge. Where
do you retail your stuff? I will be at Trunk Boutique at Cinnamon Grand and I have a
studio in Battaramula. What is your top fashion tip? Go with the classics. Mind the fit
before the trend. A good fit, transforms you. Trends, kind of sit on you like a that.
Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? There isn't one shop I can say I frequent. I shop
at most of the popular boutiques in Colombo, but also get some made for myself and order
online at times. Who is your muse? I don’t have a particular person. But many different
types of women inspire me, and I can spin a whole collection in my ead, when I meet them.
Fashion prediction for next season? More and more fashion doesn't come out in seasons as
homogeneously as we used to see. Seems there are many different trends to help
individuality shine. I saw boho romantic to utilty look in trend forecasts. Who would you
like seeing dressed in your creations? Women that are confident, interesting and
interested in good things. I know many that aren’t famous. Michelle Obama and Amal Clooney
could be lovely to dress. How do you balance creativity with commerce? One has to be
honest about the design and its production. So, commerce ends up not considered much. I
need help with that. Which designers are you influenced by? I like so many. But Cristian
Dior, Alberta Ferretti, Elie Saab, Prabal Gurung, Vivienne Westwood, Anna Sui are some.

life_fashion90_23_Designer_1-2-1_Twinkle_Goonethilleke.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Twinkle Goonethilleke
Oct 12 2021. Designer Twinkle Goonethilleke was scheduled to launch THE HIGHNESS - Journey
of a Dress in December 2021 in France at the Paris American Academy where she had worked
as an intern and gained experience at Paris Fashion Week. However, with the numerous
lockdowns, this did not materialize and has now been rescheduled to December 2021.
Recently Twinkle designed her own dress for the final crown shoot of Miss
Intercontinental. What sparked your interest in fashion design? I’m very good at art and
sketching. It’s my born talent. My mother observed my talents and urged me to take part in
a fashion designing competition by Mrs. Chula Nanayakkara Ariyarathne. I sent my own
designs as per the given criteria, such as Eveningwear, Office wear, Casual wear, and
Saree wear. I was the youngest contestant among 200 contestants and I was selected for the
finals and became the youngest Fashion Designer of the Year in 2007. What made you take
fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? After I was awarded the Fashion
Designer in the year 2007 at the age of 11, I thought to myself, this is my path as a
career to be chosen in the future. I received a lot of press attention after the win, but
due to the strict rules of my Alma Mater Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo I was not able to
further this ambition until I left school. I realised fashion design is a good choice and
it is a lucrative career. Are you self-taught or did you study fashion design? I am self-
taught. I joined the Women’s State University Bangalore in India where I graduated as a
qualified fashion designer. Thereafter, my university sent me to Paris American Academy,
France for my internship. During my stay in Paris, I gained fashion experience at Paris
Fashion Week. Also, I got an opportunity to study under the renowned famous fashion
designer Manish Arora. How has your work evolved since you began your own label? For the
launch of my label, I aim to target the local market and Mumbai and Paris. In Sri Lanka,
my focus is on a ready to wear and wrap dress collection while in Mumbai and Paris I will
focus on colourful fabrics in traditional silhouettes and Haute Couture adding my personal
flair to the designs. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? Basically,
I avoid designing too loose clothes, trousers, coarse-looking dresses, jumpsuits and
cardigans. Where do you look for creative inspiration? I always look up to 90s style
celebrities like Cindy Crawford, Victoria Beckham, DVF, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer.
My creative inspiration is derived from vintage and contemporary fashion, rich heritage,
print and colour. Who is your muse? My muse is my mother. She is my all-time inspiration
and fashionista since childhood. I always see the way she dresses up for work very
glamorously. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your
company? When I started doing designing and my own range, you should not release anything
or discuss it with anyone until it comes to a conclusion. Also not to share your
uniqueness with others or else it’s difficult to make your own market. What’s your motto?
“If you believe - You can achieve.” What role do you think social media plays in fashion
today? In the fashion industry, social media platforms are used to interact with the
consumer as a means of networking with others in the industry. Social media influence
designers in unique ways that are changing the way many designers create their fashions.
It has also proven to give more exposure to individual brands. How do you want women to
feel when wearing your clothes? I want them to feel confident, empowered, the highness,
proud and sophisticated women in charge. Pix Courtesy : Twinkle Tina Edward Gunawardhana

life_fashion90_23_Designer_1-2-1_with_Nithya_Yamini_Lamahewa.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 with Nithya Yamini Lamahewa
Jul 31 2017. As a fast emerging fashion hub, with several fashion schools to boot, Sri
Lanka is producing fashion designers at a prolific rate. Many have showcased their
collections at the main fashion shows in Sri Lanka, Colombo Fashion Week and Mercedes Benz
Fashion Runways. We start this series of Designer 1-2-1 with Nithya Yamini Lamahewa , a
graduate of the Academy of Design whose eponymous label Nithya is about simplicity in
fusion with traditional artisanal crafts. What is your new collection – ‘Woven Dreams’, it
is a Sri Lankan bridal collection. Why did you decide to venture into bridals? The trend
for bridals in Sri Lanka has always been maximalist designs. Minimalist designs have
started to take over the world in almost every industry. People are moving towards
minimalist designs as they help to reflect the personality and the true beauty of the
person wearing it. As a designer, I believe that the lady of the night on her wedding day
deserves to wear a saree that would show her true beauty. There are a lot of brides
nowadays in Sri Lanka who want their weddings to be minimal. In order to complete the
minimal wedding theme, something that was missing was the minimal wedding saree as minimal
bridals are a very niche market in Sri Lanka. Introducing the ‘Woven Dreams’ collection
which has minimalist sarees with a Sri Lankan twist will complete the minimal wedding
segment in Sri Lanka. ‘The minimal bride doesn't care for tons of beading, she just loves
the story behind what she wears.’ How easy was it to move from casual clothing to bridals?
All collections by ‘Nithya’ are handmade by Sri Lankan artisans using traditional crafts.
Mixing it with modern designs; every creation is something contemporary. We use the same
techniques and crafts for creating the ‘Woven Dreams’ collection as well. Hence it was the
same amount of effort and passion involved in all other ‘Nithya’ collections. What is your
top fashion tip? Never settle for anything less than a 'wholesome fashion sense' where a
man or a woman wears clothing that is an extension of their personality and values -
whether your life ethos are protecting our cultural roots, uplifting our communities or a
sustainable lifestyle, stay true to these in what you wear. Also, research on what you
wear - where was it made? Does that label employ children? Are you promoting unhealthy
work practices by buying from that label? Be aware of what you wear and once you are, wear
it proudly and with no guilt. Keep smiling. Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka?

life_fashion90_23_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring__-_ALTER__Ego.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - ALTER (cid:127) Ego
Feb 14 2018. Today I feature a brand that’s truly Lankan , easy on the body and light to
the touch. I have always been a big fan of short sleeve shirts, although my arms are far
from being flattering. “The short sleeve shirt” is looked upon by some with a certain
amount of caution and, at times, even dislike. It is also associated with the uniform of a
school kid, but this can be a fashion statement in our hot county. Their long sleeve look
has a sharp “ comfiness”. This online men's designer brand is a must try if you want to
breathe and feel free. They have limited pieces per design and you can message them on
Facebook, Instagram or simply e-mail them on alter.ego2017@hotmail.com I spoke to the
designer, Malisha Nicoli, on her design journey: 1. What is ALTER (cid:127) Ego about? ALTER (cid:127) Ego
menswear is a newly launched clothing brand re-defining men’s fashion in Sri Lanka by
catering to a diverse nature of personalities through its carefully detailed designs. 2.
Tell me about your collection which you have featured on this shoot? The third collection,
“Street Beat” features the latest trends and design details from all-time favourite street
fashion. All pieces have its unique take on what street styled fashion is about. Taking it
from daring prints to daring seam lines, adding depth to each design individually. 3. What
would you say is missing in Men’s Fashion in Sri Lanka? Men’s fashion is a very slow
growing sector of the fashion industry. This is probably a result of the lack of
understanding what most men like in their wardrobe selections and what trends actually do
suit men in our country. 4. As we come from a tropical country, what do you keep in mind
when you source your material? My number one concern when selecting fabrics is definitely
the weight of the fabric, as our country is quite warm I like to pay close attention to
fabrics that are light in weight. All materials are tested to be 100% cotton eliminating
any irritation to skin and loosely woven letting air flow through easily. 5. How is the
competition in the Market, where do you position ALTER (cid:127) Ego? As of now, there are a very
few Designer brands doing men’s clothing purely. This makes ALTER (cid:127) Ego on a good path but
also a very risky one as we need to work twice as hard to get a menswear brand just as
trending as a women’s wear brand. We are still making our mark in the industry but so far
we are glad to be making a great impact on our customers. 6. Do you see ALTER (cid:127) Ego moving
into a retails store? Yes definitely. Currently, ALTER (cid:127) Ego is a brand with limited
pieces but hoping to expand as we evolve. 7. How do you keep up with trends? For me
following up with the international runways has been a very effective way of keeping up
with trends. 8. What is the process of making your design, your inspiration/idols etc?
Every collection is done with a 3-month gap, therefore, I collect as much inspiration I
can within that period from all my sources. Inspirations come from what’s trending with
the celebrities, international brands and sometimes seasonal trends too. 9. Who do you
envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? I target the
customers with the unique sense of style when working on my designs, those who dare to
dress as the trends go. I like to give them a selection from loud fashion to very simple
fashion as that’s what this brand stands for. Serving to a variety of personalities. 10.
What are the best sellers, do the gentlemen of today like it simple or crowded, and what
is the most popular size? It’s a thin line between the contrasted detailed styles and the
minimal styles. But mostly towards the styles that have contrasting details. The most
popular size for us has been the Medium (Collar size 15.5). And starting from this
collection “Street Beat” we are introducing size XXL due to many requests from our
customers. Designer – Malisha Nicoli Photographer – Arantha Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a

clean cut designs and a structured colour palette, the Conscience summer collection was
just another great ensemble by the brand. ""This collection is a refreshing take on
military in a wearable way. It has the military at its heart, but not completely in its
look. As a designer, I love humour in design and I love taking a classic and influencing
it as best as I can."" Colombo Jewellery Stores Celebrating their 95th anniversary as one
of Colombo's leading haute jewellery stores, CJS presented a collection which reflected
their journey during the last nine decades. A collection that epitomized the legacy of

life_fashion90_23_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_2020_Emerging_Designers.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week 2020: Emerging Designers
Aug 14 2020. Colombo Fashion Week 2020 kicked off in the new normal adhering to a plethora
of strict conditions. After months of lockdown and a hiatus on social gatherings,
Colombo's fashionistas and glitterati were out in full swing to see 14 young designers
present their collections. Graduates from various fashion schools in Sri Lanka and
overseas had worked tirelessly to create collections which were innovative and fashion-
forward. Day one was dedicated solely to emerging designers. Chamanka Pehesara Making his
debut at CFW, Chamanka has fused natural fabrics, dyes and printing techniques to create a
collection inspired by the cracks that occur during volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.
Chamanka has also used layers of raw cotton fabric to create a minimalist aesthetic in
line with his brand’s vision. The calico fabric has been dyed using a mix of flour and
water and dyes to create a monochrome colour palette. The collection had a very oriental
feel to it and contained separates with asymmetrical hemlines and lots of tie details.
Hirushi Jayatilake Hirushi Jayathilake is a Sri Lankan designer based in London and Sri
Lanka. She specializes in couture and occasion wear, and her luxurious collection consists
of impeccable silhouettes, whimsical details and chic separates – all carefully
embroidered by hand. Hirushi prides herself in attention to detail, preserving the
craftsmanship and techniques of the longstanding textile and embroidery craft. Hirushi’s
designs have been exhibited by Fashion Crossover London and Not Just A Label, and she has
been published in BeauNU Magazine, and Bare Minimum UK. Hirushi supports Sri Lankan
manufacturing to promote ethical labour, craftsmanship and sustainable production. Making
her debut at Colombo fashion week Hirushi presented a collection inspired by decaying
flowers and taxidermy. Using a colour palette of black, magenta and purple the collection
of short flirty skirts and sheer tops were embellished with handpainted flowers, machine
embroidery and tambour beading. Harinda Gunawardene Harinda is a Fashion Design student at
the University of Moratuwa. His brand, HARID, focuses on an androgynous aesthetic which
plays with structured yet voluminous silhouettes. For his debut at CFW, Harinda has
incorporated the local batik craft as well as the signature detail of the brand, which is
topstitching. HARID’s mission is to push boundaries and encourage authentic expression
through fashion. Favouring a colour palette of slate, white, emerald green and orange the
collection contained batik and embroidery. Kimono tops with pleated pants enhanced the
collection. Himashi Wijeweera Himashi’s designs incorporate romantic yet contemporary
detailing, sleek lines and seek to embolden women with confidence and ease. Himashi’s core
aesthetic lies in her use of traditional handmade Beeralu lace. A celebration of
craftsmanship, she works with artisans and craftspeople from the south of Sri Lanka to
produce her Beeralu creations. In her collection, Beeralu, as expected, took centre stage.
Dull gold and dull pink net and satin fabrics were embellished with beeralu to create
kaftans, shift and body con dresses. Nilusha Maddumage Nilusha is known for her excellent
pattern-making skill and ability to manipulate fabric and narrate not just a fashion-
forward story but also one of conservation. Her creations are versatile, multi-use, and
sustainable, yet stylish statement pieces. Nilusha has a unique talent for stitching
squares of fabric together into seasonless, high-fashion clothing with barely any cuts
needed. Her process of designing and producing zero-waste fashion involves repeatedly
folding and stitching the fabric while carefully arranging geometric shapes to fit as
though it were a jigsaw puzzle. Black and grey with pops of brown were her choices of
colours. Nilusha’s USP is that her creations are all interchangeable and each outfit can
be worn in two ways. Joanne Kulamannage Joanne creates distinctively wearable clothing
that inventively blends classic tailoring with an edgy yet understated aesthetic. Making
her debut at CFW Joanne presented an edgy collection of denim ensembles which comprised
oversized shirts pleated skirts and boiler suits. Inspired by 80s Tokyo street styleretro, yellow and touches of red and white were the colours of her choice. Joanne
specializes in denim, working with local artisans to manipulate this timeless fabric into
contemporary pieces which suit the modern young woman of today. Udarika’s depth and
perspective are always apparent. A mix of thought-provoking and surrealist, she brings her
vision to life through an effortless combination of fashion and art, which highlights her
aesthetic and style. Her collections take you on a creative journey which showcases her
strong silhouettes and passion for creative art design. This season she presented a
collection which featured graphic faces interspersed with prints in caramel tones with
accent colours of green and white. Dresses, shorts and oversized wrap skirts added
interest. Thamodha Geegamage Sustainable fashion is a core principle of Thamoda’s brand
TAOA. For her debut collection, Thamoda uses Sri Lankan motifs and craft elements. The
colours and visual forms are unified with the Broderie Anglaise technique, a remnant of
Portuguese and British colonial influence on the island between the 16th to 19th century.
The silhouettes are minimal yet modern and play with traditional Sri Lankan clothing while
focusing on comfort and ease. She used an earthy colour palette of olives, brown white and
sand to create a collection which enhanced the feminine silhouette. Mikhail Hameed This
Fashion Design student currently studying at Ryerson University Toronto, Canada launched
his debut collection at the CFW Summer 2020 Emerging Designer showcase. Mikail draws
inspiration from East Asia, giving his designs a youthful twist and creating an elegant
yet casual look while allowing comfort and style to coexist with minimal effort. Mikail
has incorporated refined lines and neutral colours for a chic and elegant look while using
natural fabrics such as linen and twill he strives to achieve a conscious effort to reduce
the negative impact of fashion on the environment. Ayesh Wickramarathne As a designer,
Ayesh’s strength lies in his silhouettes, creative patternmaking and draping techniques.
Ayesh is also passionate about sustainable fashion and continues to experiment with
techniques such as natural printing and zero waste design practices, which he incorporates
into his collections. Inspired by the Black Panther movie and its cross cultures of
Japanese, African tribes, Bohemian has influenced in creating this collection along with
the movie colours, silhouettes and feelings. The movie contains a mythical energy names
vibranium & the promising trust of sustainability which is the backbone of this
collection. He used a colour palette of grey, brown and petrol with a pop of red, to
create a collection of clothing which focused heavily on draping. Divya Jayawickrama Divya
designs with sustainability in mind and uses no waste, reversible and convertible
techniques in her collections. Radical patternmaking, textile development, bold
manipulations and meticulous research go hand in hand with her ambition and will to create
something new and modern. Her clothing brand “MOWCHA”, is a unisex brand and made its
debut at Colombo Fashion Week Summer 2020. Favouring a grey colour palette with white and
shades of taupe her collection comprised oversized jackets high waisted pants and dresses
in quirky headgear which had a military edge to it. Achala Leekoh Since inception,
Achala’s brand Leekoh has promoted the concept of “exclusive prints with a conscience”;
she steers away from traditional water-based printing due to its negative impact on the
environment and instead uses digitized printing processes which has minimal to no waste
residue. She presented a luxe collection using a colour palette of black and white with
accent colours of yellow. Frills and pleats featured heavily in this collection which
Acahala says was inspired by Gaudi and the Sagrada Familia. The surface prints are mainly
rooted in an unfinished cathedral element which is central to the Gaudi’s masterpiece and
the infamous spiralling stairwell has inspired the even pleating details. Ranga
Senavirathne Ranga’s strength lies in print development, where he blends edgy, grunge
styles and gothic cultural vibes with modern art influences. Ranga’s debut collection for
CFW’s Emerging Designer showcase incorporates a street aesthetic which includes a hint of
athletic and casual elements. His brand vision is to create unique menswear with a specialfocus on prints. Pics by Kushan Pathiraja Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_23_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_21_Emerging_Designers__The_Talent.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week ‘21: Emerging Designers – The Talent of Tomorrow
Mar 25 2021. HSBC Colombo Fashion Week continues to showcase the latest emerging talent to
the world, by exhibiting the fashion innovators of tomorrow. Day one of HSBC CFW kicked
off with eleven emerging designers showcasing their collections at the Shangri-la,
Colombo. After having undergone an extensive three-month training and mentoring program
with CFW Founder and President, Ajai Vir Singh, CEO, Fazeena Rajabdeen and respected
designer Upeksha Deegala, these young designers have created collections that contain
elements of Sri Lankan heritage crafts ranging from batik and beeralu to handloom weaving
and embroidery. Inspired by a range of causes and elements the designers have put forth a
strong point of view through their collections. Navindri Ranatunga Using a mix of fabrics
and prints which gave a varied touch and feel to the collection, the browns and burgundies
with accent colours of green and gold complemented the silhouettes Navindri presented.
Pleats and a few statement sleeves featured in her collection. Chamanka Pehesara An edgy
collection in earthy tones with accent colours of gold also had beautiful embellishments
such as gold beading. He mixed separates with dresses and used velvet, faux leather and
suede. His stud work and exposed zips lent a punk vibe to his collection. Nisansala
Deegala Whites, beiges and ivories formed the colour palette for this collection which had
brass embellishments alongside delicate embroidery. The silhouettes flattered the female
form and the use of embroidered corsets added interest to the collection. Nipunika
Fernando Using the Sanni face as her leitmotif, Nipunika had created a set of cheeky
prints in green, purple, gold and latte. She complimented her silhouettes with the
interesting use of harnesses. Kavishna Kuruvitage Not afraid to use bold colours in her
predominantly batik collection Kavishna’s collection was outstanding. Her leitmotif of a
skull which was sequins and embroidery was reminiscent of Damian Hirst’s studded skull.
She had created abstract prints in blue, green and black with a pop of pink, making this
an extremely wearable collection. She has presented an outstanding batik collection.
Abstract art in times of blue-green and black with a lop of pink wearable silhouettes in
cotton and silk. Ishani Rajapaksha Clever and artistic use of knife pleats characterized
this batik collection by Ishani. Using simple lines to create eye-catching silhouettes,
her batiks in a range of silks lent a luxe look to this collection. Hasindu Jayasinghe
Asymmetrical hemlines dominated this collection which was created using grey and blue in
the main. Statement sleeved and clever cutouts were the hallmarks of this collection.
Hasindu had used batik and embroidery to reference his inspiration which was based on the
harrowing testimony of a child abuse survivor. He used bell sleeves to convey emotion and
to highlight the feminine features of his collection. Divya Jayawickrama Elevating the
status of calico one of the most versatile and utilitarian fabrics, by using block
printing techniques Divya created a collection inspired by a pack of playing cards.
Monochromatic patterns came together to create interesting prints which were presented as
jumpsuits, dresses and oversized trench coats. Naduni Katuwandeniya Paying homage to the
artisanal craft of beeralu, Naduni showcased a collection in vibrant hues of saffron,
lavender-blue and navy. She has fused intricate panels of beeralu panels both vertically
and horizontally to create pants dresses skirts and pants. A collection with a boho vibe
this collection was fun and flirty. Akarsh Paranavitharana A definite one to watch,
Akarsh’s collection had a sleek sophistication to it. Working with panels of fabric woven
from reeds incorporated with twill he had created a collection that referenced a stylized
Japanese aesthetic. Bustiers in woven reeds peeked under beautifully crafted jackets. He
had also created a line of accessories that added drama to his looks. Hashani Fernando
Khaki and tan combined with accent colours of tangerine formed the colour palette for
Hashani’s collection. Using embroidery and crochet we saw jumpsuits, flirty dresses and
sarongs grace the runway. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel,fashion, lifestyle, cuisine and personalities. She is also the Deputy Editor for Hi!!

life_fashion90_23_Mercedes_Benz_Fashion_Week_Sri_Lanka.pdf,"Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka
Oct 22 2018. Celebrating the second edition of Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka, the
stage is set for three fashion filled days which will see a range of Sri Lanka’s finest
fashion designers showcase their collections. From new designers and industry stalwarts to
trade professionals, the runways will come alive with an eclectic collection of fashion.
This year the theme of the event is Innovation Island which has been created by AOD, one
of the key stakeholders in this event. In an exclusive interview Founder of AOD, Linda
Speldewinde and Creative Director of AOD Karen McLeod outline their vision this the
upcoming MBFW Sri Lanka. Linda Speldewinde What is Innovation Island? ‘Innovation Island’
is an international campaign conceptualized by AOD and will unfold with Mercedes-Benz
Fashion Week this year.Through ‘Innovation Island’ Sri Lanka is presenting a fantastic
business proposition to the world. It’s coming from a powerful business ecosystem where
human creativity, ideas, intellectual property, commerce and technology are in constant
interplay. And, at the heart of this proposition is AOD—the creative force. AOD has spent
15 years facilitating and advocating Sri Lanka’s unique role as the regional creative hub
and through ‘Innovation Island’ international campaign Sri Lanka will now invite the world
to make business here. AOD will be unveiling the campaign with the 2018 editions of
Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week, where nearly hundred delegates from around the world will
gather to engage with Sri Lanka—South Asia’s ‘Innovation Island’. Why did you come up with
this concept? Over the years we have been creating our own proposition to strategically
put Sri Lanka on the global map. We are building international networks and this will be
further elevated at this year’s event. With leaders in apparel, automobile, hospitality
and tourism industries collaborating with AOD, Lankan creative industries send out
powerful global message at Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week and Sri Lanka Design Festival What
attributes makes Sri Lanka an Innovation Island? Sri Lanka really is an unusual creative
hub where innovation takes its own unique shape inspired by a very rich heritage, charged
by the young energy of homegrown talent and strong modern industrial strengths. It is a
fresh creative dynamic out of South Asia, and this is what ‘Innovation Island’
encapsulates.” 4) What role does MBFW Sri Lanka play in Innovation Island? Mercedes-Benz
Fashion Week Sri Lanka is an international fashion week which takes place in Sri Lanka
that is managed by a global chain. This gives us a global leverage to push innovation in
design. Our runways, our forums, our collaborations and the eco-system we have created
around this event is helping Sri Lanka to be on the global map 5 ) AOD has many
international friends. What has been their response to Innovation Island? I have been
travelling a lot this year, working on bringing this amazing world of design and
innovation to Sri Lanka to create the next version of design innovation to Sri Lanka. This
year we will have a large delegation here both on and off the runways. Karen: How many
designers will be taking part? The shows run over three days and in total we have 65
designers What is being showcased on the different days? Day 1 is Emerging Talent, which
will feature international fashion schools. Day 2 is trans-seasonal clothing with a focus
on heritage craft. Day 3 is apparel. Who are the designers to look out for? Each designer
/ company is bringing something unique to the runway this year and I am unable to choose a
favourite. Day 1 will be quite interesting this year as it is not only the AOD graduate
runway, but designers from international schools will also be showcasing on this day.
Designers for Day 2, have been chosen by an international panel and only the finalists
will be on the runway. Our amazing apparel industry will be showcasing on Day 3. What key
roles do AOD play in MBFW SL in particular? We are the design catalyst presenting
Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week with our partner DIMO. We are involved in the event organising,
content curation to delivery along with our other amazing partners, who make this event
what it is. What sets MBFWSL aside from others shows in Sri Lanka? We pride ourselves inproducing shows that meet international standards and the recognition we receive from
international entities such as LFW and GFW, is a validation for the amazing work we do.
How much of ethical and sustainable fashion can we expect from the designers? Day 2 has a
strong focus on sustainable fashion with the majority of the collections featuring
heritage crafts like Handloom (Umanga, Thamali), Batik (Ramona, Natalie), and Beeralu Lace
(KUR, Charini). Our industry patron Hirdaramani is recycling denim on Day 3 and Lonali
will be doing an up-cycled collection. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_23_OLU_Swimweek__Colombo_Day_2.pdf,"OLU Swimweek Colombo: Day 2
Aug 10 2019. Seasoned designers took to the fore on Day 2 of Olu Swim Week Colombo at the
Galle Face Hotel. An arresting backdrop provided by the setting sun and the ocean breeze
at the Galle Face Hotel, the grand dame of Hotels in Colombo, proved to be a spectacular
evening. 8 designers, both local and international, showcased their collection of swim and
resort wear. Sonali Dharmawardene Opening for Day 2 Sonali presented a collection of her
signature batik looks sticking to a colour palette of bright pinks and oranges in the
main. Foil embellishments added glamour and complemented her fabric which had beautiful
floral designs. Titled ‘Celebrating Life’, Sonali’s collection was a tribute to all Sri
Lankans celebrating being one as a nation. Inspired by the lush colours and thriving
spirit of its homeland, animal prints and floral prints dominated this collection of
bikini and one-piece swimsuits. From snakeskin print to florals, Aviva’s swimwear ended on
a sparkly high note with its final pieces embodying a 70’s retro glam look in glittering
golds and silvers. Making its debut at Swim Week Colombo, the label ‘Wraith’ by Dinesh
Chandrasena presented a range of diverse swimwear in vibrant colours of crimson, canary
and cerulean that gave the collection a youthful vibe to it. Her use of bold floral prints
added an interesting dimension to her collection of bikinis, one pieces and coverups.
Pigeon Island A tropical wear brand inspired by the marine ecosystem, Pigeon Island
presented a collection that paid homage to the brands design philosophy with easy
silhouettes and muted colour palettes of blue, green, orange and white that celebrated the
tropical vibrations of nature and the beauty of our rich marine ecosystem. Peace and
diversity influenced this collection which featured elements of embroidery that are
associated with the brand. Using a mix of fabrics sourced from their travel’s, sisters
Rusla and Najila have also use Sri Lankan cheeththa prints in their collection. Sleek
silhouettes with a flirty vibe were portrayed in this collection. Staying true to her
affinity to batik, Dinushi’s collection of swim wear was inspired by the movement of
water. Abstract batik designs in various tones of brown were complemented with embroiders
and sequin embellishments. Studio Verandah Filling a gap for chic, original and
responsible resort wear, Studio Verandah’s semi-luxe collection celebrated the bohemian
woman with a diverse range of prints and neutrals and a pop of colour with the crafty use
of glitter. Stylish monokinis, one piece swim suits with daring cuts and flirty bikini’s
embodied the bohemian spirit! The finale collection for Day 2 by MAUS presented elegant,
classic swimwear and silhouettes in a range of pastel colours of beige, black, navy,
turquoise, brick red, baby blues and pinks. Bikini’s and one-piece swimsuits in block
colours and checkered prints kept with the brand’s ethos of clean-cut design. MAUS also
featured a range of stylish footwear and accessories perfect for the tropics. By: Tina

life_fashion90_23_Re-emerging_2000s_Fashion_Heres_how_to_style_it_for_2025_-_L.pdf,"Re-emerging 2000s Fashion: Here’s how to style it for 2025 - Ladies Edition
Sep 02 2024. As a stylist, you wouldn’t believe how much of my job is a scavenger hunt
based on the misplaced nostalgia of my clients. I like to think of Fashion trends as well-
placed nostalgia; that would be the rest of my job I have to keep track of. Fashion trends
are like that well-dressed aunt that refuses to let go of that top from the 70s she once
wore to a party, or anything that looks like it she’s brought ever since. Critically,
we’ve been cycling between the 20s to the 70s every few years, and then the 90s when it
all fails. This year we even hit the quirky ‘aughts (early 2000s) fashion archives. The
early 2000s were a time of bold fashion choices and experimental styles. As these trends
make a comeback in 2025, they bring with them a sense of nostalgia and fun. By
incorporating these key items into your wardrobe and styling them with a modern twist, you
can create looks that are both trendy and timeless. Whether you’re a fan of low-rise jeans
or waistcoats, there’s something for everyone in this revival of early 2000s fashion. 1.
Embellished Jeans Low-rise jeans were a staple of early 2000s fashion, often paired with
crop tops to show off the midriff. This trend is back, with a modern twist. Today’s low-
rise jeans come in various styles, from flared to skinny, and are often seen in distressed
or embellished designs. Stories went viral from spring/summer of beaded pants from the
Valentino show and that trend has now trickled down to rhinestone studded jean jackets and
straight cut/mom jeans for both men and women. Styling Tip : Pair your embellished jeans
with a fitted neutral-coloured crop top or a loose, oversized tee for a balanced look. Add
a pair of chunky sneakers to complete the outfit. 2. Mini Skirts Mini skirts were a
defining element of early 2000s fashion, often seen in denim or pleated styles. This trend
is back, with modern variations including leather and satin mini skirts as seen at the
CULT original, Mimosa & ELE Fashion. Styling Tip: Pair a mini skirt with a fitted shirt
for that brat aesthetic or a coordinated or mismatched waistcoat for that demure vibe.
Platform shoes would be best to elongate your legs and create a chic silhouette, but
chunky heels with a tie-up or strappy element are your next bet. Bonus points if you mix
in athletic socks, but I doubt Lankans would be that daring, 3. Baby Tees Baby tees,
characterised by their tight fit and cropped length, are another early 2000s trend making
a comeback. These tees are perfect for layering or wearing on their own for a casual,
laid-back look. Take it one step further with a tiny embroidery or print reminiscent of
the 90s. Styling Tip: Wear a baby tee with high-waisted jeans or a midi skirt. Layer with
a denim jacket or a cardigan for added warmth and style. 4. Cargo Pants Cargo pants, known
for their multiple pockets and relaxed fit, were a popular choice in the early 2000s. They
are now being reintroduced with a more tailored and streamlined design. Lighter and chic’
fabrics as well as colour tones that are a pastel lavender are very much Gen Z as well as
Gen Alpha. Even the accessories used with it (zips, tags and tacks) all echo tech wear
influences of the past few years for a fresh new look for men and women alike and they are
a sure hit as I seem to never find them in the appropriate size when I’m looking for them
at any retailer in town. Styling Tip: Pair cargo pants with a fitted tank top or a
bodysuit. Add a pair of chunky boots or sneakers for a utilitarian yet fashionable look.
5. Halter Tops Halter tops, which tie around the neck and leave the shoulders bare, were a
popular choice for both casual and dressy occasions in the early 2000s. This trend is
back, with updated fabrics and cutouts at the sides, not to mention full maxi-length dress
variations that lean into futuristic aesthetics brought on by our dystopian movies as of
late. Styling Tip: Wear a halter top with high-waisted trousers or a maxi skirt. Add gold
bauble style statement earrings and a clutch that’s rubber or sequin pieced for a
sophisticated evening look. 6. Denim on Denim The double denim trend, often referred to as
the “Canadian tuxedo,” was a hallmark of early 2000s fashion (please try to forget ‘this
will ruin the world tour’ JT & Britney matching set). This trend is making a comeback witha more polished and coordinated approach with darker tones in looser fits and making sure
it’s perceived as a more smart casual outfit than anything else. Styling Tip: Pair a denim
jacket with matching jeans or a denim skirt. Keep the look cohesive by choosing similar
washes and adding neutral accessories. A fashion stylist with a decade of experience as an

life_fashion90_23_The_Bare_Minimum_To_Looking_Good__Grooming_Essentials_For_Th.pdf,"The Bare Minimum To Looking Good: Grooming Essentials For The Lankan Man
May 07 2024. I’m sorry to say it, men - waking up and splashing water across your face
just doesn’t cut it anymore. In the post-pandemic world, everyone is aware of the minimum
‘self-care’ required to feel great, but in 2024 is that enough? Even as Sri Lanka’s
corporate culture is evolving from antiquated notions on wardrobe and grooming
requirements, it doesn’t change the fact that the better-dressed and meticulously groomed
individual will always have the advantage. In an American study conducted on
attractiveness and intergenerational social mobility (Gugushvili, Alexi, and Grzegorz
Bulczak, 2023), men perceived to be good-looking and well-kept advanced much faster than
their counterparts; while another older study published in the journal for Research in
Social Stratification and Mobility found that being consistently well dressed and well-
kept was the key factor in predicting a person’s salary, regardless of education, family
background, weight or race. But statistics aside, we would all have personal experiences
on how Sri Lankans can be quite prejudiced towards how we look, or the way we dress. The
world we live in may be more accepting of diverse individuals from all walks of life, but
there is no compromise on looking good, dressing well and taking care of one’s own
appearance. Here are some of the layers you might want to create a checklist out of. It
just might help you zoom up that corporate or social ladder. The Base Layer: Face The
responsibility of looking great falls on our faces and the most basic thing you can do is
to find something less abrasive than soap to clean it with! There is no denying the world
we live in is constantly throwing pollutants at us, and they accumulate right throughout
the day on our faces whether we work in an A/C office or take the bus. If you are prone to
breakouts or an oily feel, you might be pleasantly surprised to find even supermarkets
offer a range of cleansing face washes right next to your shaving supplies or preferred
soap. Whatever else you don’t do, please add a face wash to your routine and see the
results. Sub Layer: Beards Thank God we live in a time where being clean-shaven is not a
mandatory requirement. Neatly trimmed stubble that follows growth outlines seems to dazzle
ladies and bosses, and there are so many hair and grooming places that have popped up
exclusively for men that are super affordable. If your facial hair is limited to certain
areas or ends up patchy, it might be best to go against this hairy moment in history and
try the clean-shaven look. I hear there are many women who are into that. These women are
not my friends, but I heard they exist. Somewhere. Top Layer: Hair When men came out of
lockdown; there were only two looks; Buzzed or Long. But thankfully, we’ve all come to
appreciate the latter in many ways. For one thing, men’s hair is longer and approved of by
workplaces or the service industry. Whether you choose to indulge in perms (a-la gen-z and
K-pop influence) or that weird version of a short-sided mullet; the options are endless
and the demand for having great-looking hair is very high. If you are still in doubt about
what your hair should look like, visiting a men’s hair expert to find out what works for
your face, and how you can manage that look with your lifestyle is recommended. Do not
trust TikTok or YouTube videos for big changes. Essential Layer: Scent I don’t want to
beat around the bush. Every man should use a roll-on deodorant. It should be punishable by
law to inflict your body odour on anyone. I’m also not one to tout the need for expensive
perfume or smelling good in an article on basic grooming, I’m simply saying don’t smell
bad; Everyone should make an effort to not smell bad. Please. I do understand how some
people are immune to their own smell, but in a tropical country where it’s got a humidity
as bad as ours coupled with temperamental weather, you don’t want to be trapped in any
space with someone who missed their basic hygiene checklist that day. I don’t trust
sprays, and neither do I trust people who spray perfume over bad body odour. You deserve
better dude. So do we. Bonus Layer: Clothing We’ve covered everything else, you probably
look great, feel great (and smell ‘ok’), but all of it falls short if you’ve not pulled onsome great clothing over that. If we are talking essentials, I feel something that gets
really overlooked with Men in Sri Lanka is finding versatile pieces that work for you the
whole week rather than weekdays or weekends. Dry clean your tired-looking clothes once in
a while, iron out a t-shirt or even your jeans. There is something about your clothes
looking crisp that instantly gives you glow-up status in public. A fashion stylist with a

life_fashion90_24_Allys.pdf,"Ally’s
Oct 11 2017. Today I feature one of my favourite thing of all fashion items, Shoes!
although people think men do not have to fuss about shoes, those days are gone. now its
important to pick the shoes which goes well with your look and outfit and in Sri Lanka, is
too hard to find a god fit and for tall people, it’s hard to find shoes which fit and if
you get those sorted, we cant keep up with trends. but now on takas.lk an exclusive
collection called Ally’s is answering your cry. I loved the fit and the finish. Today I
caught up this partnership Maalik and Lahiru. Maalik & Lahiru What’s with the name Ally’s
? Ally Weerasinghe is the founder of Almar Group, of which SSL (Service Shoes Lanka - the
factory that produces these shoes) is a subsidiary. Ally Weerasinghe always enjoyed the
finer things in life. Impeccably dressed and always in stylish shoes, “Ally’s” was the
natural choice for the name of the brand - an ode to a stylish man and his legacy. Tell me
about the collection you have featured in this shoot? This is a collection of traditional
and contemporary footwear. Providing the Sri Lankan consumer with a wider range of options
from brogues to boots, loafers to sneakers and formal to less formal, Ally’s caters to the
quintessential gentleman. Considering the limitations imposed by the footwear available in
the local market, our aim was to balance modern design and impeccable craftsmanship while
providing our customers with access to shoes they would otherwise have to travel overseas
to purchase. What would you say is missing in men’s fashion in Sri Lanka ? Stylish
footwear! Everyone I meet shares their frustration and their compulsion to by shoes
overseas. Local consumers are limited to a variety of low quality sandals, elongated and
outdated formal shoes and a few other imported low quality shoes. As a brand, how many
pieces do you introduce in a collection? Do you produce custom made shoes? Each collection
aims to increase the variety available to local consumers. We like to share a few
classics, a few contemporary designs using innovative material and also a few shoes that
serve a dual role such as formal loafers that would easily move from a workplace to a
night out and even extend to the weekend. Custom made shoes isn’t something we’re
focussing on right now but perhaps a consideration in the future. Tell me the story, what
prompted you to start this? This is a long answer - to keep it brief, the lack of well
crafted stylish shoes in the local market was definitely a catalyst. I know you are online
now, and it is a difficult platform to market a product in. therefore, would you be moving
into a retail platform? While online might be thought of as difficult, many younger
consumers prefer to buy online for a number of reasons. Therefore, given the audience
we’re catering to, I am confident that an online platform is a good place to start. Also,
for those less inclined to shop online, the products are available through a few select
retail platforms such as Hameedia’s and Odel. Why do you think it is hard to find Stylish
men’s footwear in Sri Lanka and why aren’t they available in a wide variety of sizes? At
Ally’s we would like to show the local market that elongated shoes in one particular
design is not what is trending in the international market and allow the consumer to
choose from a range of shoes that is on par with stylish shoes found anywhere in the
world. We use the very best leathers, and continue to innovate with the finest soles using
leather and other materials that aren’t common in the local market. As for sizing, because
many of the shoes are imported from low quality suppliers who focus on volume, they cater
to one particular market segment alone. What is the process of creating and marketing your
design? You design inspiration ? Each shoe has been influenced by a number of sources of
inspiration, capturing an array of unique finishes and techniques along the way. Because
our designers have extensive knowledge and experience in the footwear industry we are
constantly experimenting with techniques, treatments and the quality of leathers. We
strive to innovate, surprise and push boundaries in footwear design. What would you say is
the trend for 2017 ? Definitely sneakers and formal shoes with less formal soles. I alsospoke to the frontman of Takas.lk about Ally’s What made Takas.lk tie up with Ally’s?
Takas currently has a stellar relationship with great brands! Ally’s is one such amazing
brand coming up with an incredible product. It’s very hard to find a quality gents shoe in
Sri Lanka which is value for money. We jumped on the chance of being an outlet to Ally’s
to sell the product to our consumers across the island. As it’s new on your online space,
how has the feedback been? Things have been flying off the shelf at takas so far. This is
with essentially no marketing at all. The quality of the shoe essentially speaks for
itself, and we have had a great run so far. Are consumers okay with buying online without
trying them on? There is a challenge with sizes, but we do free returns if the size is not
just right. We also take a lot of the guesswork out by putting a size chart. Ally’s is
made to international standards so the size chart is very accurate. I buy my Ally’s
online. Designer – Maalik Aziz Photographer – Nuwan Thanranga Video - X IRIS (Nuwan and

Dec 10 2021. The countdown has begun for the eagerly anticipated Mercedes Benz Fashion
Week Sri Lanka gets underway, the designers are in a frenzy of excitement. Spending their
time months in advance, planning and executing their collections several of Sri Lanka’s
finest design talent have come together under the aegis of the AOD to showcase their
collections at MBFW SL. Many of AOD’s stellar alumni such as Lonali Rodrigo, Shimalka
Bodaragama, Tharshana Wijesinghe, Amesh Wijesekera, and Kasuni Rathnasuriya are all set to
inject a high fashion vibe to the show when they showcase their collections. Pictured:
Kasuni The theme of this year’s show is The New Local. An effort to harness the
entrepreneurial spirit and utilise creativity incorporating Sri Lanka’s artisan crafts and
send a powerful message that Sri Lanka is upping its game in the fashion industry. Playing
its part in taking this message forward, Urban Island and Fashionmarket.lk spinoff
enterprises of AOD have been very successful. FMLK and UI have really made an impact in
terms of taking Sri Lanka’s story global, and they are looking to scale this exponentially
in the next few years. With the international partnerships they are currently developing,
and their growing ecosystem, this is what consumers will see in the next 3-5 years with a
focus on using design for export. AOD students strive hard to maintain their creative and
competitive edge. This is due to the fact that AOD is always changing, always disrupting,
always evolving. At AOD the students are the heart of everything they do and the ethos
they instil in the young minds of the students hold them in good stead. Amesh Wijesekera
is one of AOD’s biggest success stories. Having won the Graduate show a few years back
Amesh has gone from strength to strength. Amesh’s design response has much to do with the
London scene and Sri Lanka which influenced him a lot. There is also Kasuni leading KUR,
who has done a lot on her own with her influence from New York and delivering something
very fresh from that cool North American aesthetic with subtle connections to Sri Lanka.
According to Linda Speldewinde, the Founder of AOD her next step is to finish work with
one of her other designers Ishara who is based in Norway and has a very special talent
with amazing potential to drive a new Sri Lankan style that sits with the Scandinavian
aesthetics. Pictured: Lonali Ruwanthi is another AOD alumnus who brings a wealth of know-
how and talent in textile, working on every possible textile in Sri Lanka, experimenting
with natural dyes, and ready to create something really remarkable. These are the
immediate stars of AOD. Continuously monitoring their design talent the AOD has also
picked a few more who are still studying at AOD to become the next big names to focus on
and build for the future of Sri Lankan fashion. These are the kind of designers who will
bring name and fame to the country by building hype and recognition for Sri Lankan talent
in the international fashion scene. Pictured: Tharshana Another success story of the AOD
fashion shows are designers such as Sajee Mendes and Nithya Lamahewa who contribute by
scaling in exports in the more commercial space. Often billed as a hothouse for incubating
design talent, the MBFW SL will showcase some amazing and diverse designers who have the
potential to put Sri Lanka at the fashion forefront in the global arena. Tina Edward

Aug 12 2019. A weeklong celebration of Colombo came to a grand end with the Celebrate
Colombo Tribute Show at the Taj Hotel on Sunday. 13 designers from Sri Lanka and India
paid tribute to the resilient spirit of Sri Lanka by presenting collections that denoted
their interpretation of peace, unity and reconciliation. The 13 designers that paid
tribute included Sri Lankan labels Buddhi Batiks Indi by Indi Dimuthu Sahabandu Sonali
Dharmawardena Jai by Jaish The night also designs by Indian labels; Tarun Tahiliani
Abraham and Thakore Rajesh Pratap Singh Nivedita Saboo Hemant Trivedi With white as the
core theme, the designs featured various imagery of signs of peace from doves, hearts and
angel wings. Respected Indian designer Tarun Tahilian i who was present at the show sent
three outfits down the runway with moving messages of solidarity that truly resonated with
the people of Colombo. ""Peace be with you Colombo!"" shared Tarun. Seasoned Sri Lankan
designers presented a perfect juxtapose by using delicate fabrics such as lace and mesh to
convey a sense of fragility while designers like Sonali contrasted with colour to convey
our country’s undeniable strength and perseverance to come back from even the most
impossible of situations. The tribute show was a fitting finale to what has been Colombo’s
biggest line of social events this year and brought hope, love and support to Sri Lanka.

life_fashion90_24_Designer_1-2-1_Gayathri_Lindagedara.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Gayathri Lindagedara
Aug 17 2021. Architect Gayathri Lindagedara founded Kudya as a creative outlet turning out
bold accessories made mostly of brass. Meaning curiosity in Sanskrit, the Kudya brand’s
products are pieces to be cherished by all. Name of brand: Kudya When did you launch your
brand? I launched Kudya in November 2020 and had my first in-store launch at The Design
Collective at the beginning of February. What sparked your interest in jewellery design?
During my time as an Architecture student, I was surrounded by many architects who carried
through their design consciousness into the way they impeccably dressed and styled
themselves. One such person was my mentor and now good friend Architect Amila De Mel.
Seeing her curation of bold statement pieces with unorthodox materials collected from
around the world made me fall in love with jewellery. What made you take Jewellery design
more seriously and make a career out of it? I simply wanted to create jewellery that I
would enjoy wearing, unique, enduring and locally made and be able to share that joy with
everyone else. Are you self taught or did you study jewellery design? As I am an architect
by profession, I apply a lot of the design principles I have learnt over the years
together with experimentation to conceptualize my designs. But I have immense gratitude
for the craftsmen I work with for teaching me the technical aspects of this field. Where
do you look for creative inspiration? I try not to limit myself when it comes to sources
of inspiration. It could range from Art to Mathematics. Derived from the Sanskrit word for
curiosity, the name Kudya embodies our spirit that is ever wandering in a boundless search
for inspiration. Describe your latest collection? Our first collection was simply about
starting at the very beginning and exploring the primary element of design - the point, in
its static and kinetic form to give you playful and versatile pieces of jewellery. “All
pictorial form begins with the point that sets itself in motion…” (Paul Klee, The Thinking
Eye: The notebooks of Paul Klee) Who is your muse? Anyone with a strong sense of personal
style and expression. I’m inspired by those who aren’t afraid to be bold and unorthodox.
What are your sustainability credentials? While I don’t claim to be ‘sustainable’ as
sustainability is a very broad term and has unfortunately been misused in the fashion
industry, every decision I take is with a conscience to reduce our impact on the
environment as much as possible. Kudnya jewellery is made of solid brass without any gold-
plating. As plating is a temporary finish, I believe it is an unfortunate waste of
precious metals and therefore I refrain from it. One reason I use brass is that almost 90%
of brass available in the market today is recycled. Customers can easily maintain their
Kudnya jewellery at home using simple and easily available ingredients. The packaging I
use is made of Kraft board which is 100% biodegradable and also 100% recyclable. The
jewellery pouch you receive with each purchase is made by a local, independent seamstress
using fabric off-cuts. What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into
your work? The material brass. This golden-toned metal is durable, malleable, resists
corrosion and is recyclable, all without the hefty price tag of gold. The antique patina
it forms over time carries a charm incomparable to gold or silver. This allows me to
create bold, statement pieces that are enduring and accessible. While brass jewellery is
still underrated in Colombo, you can look forward to Kudya celebrating this material with
our future collections at The Design Collective. Which international or local designers
are you inspired by? Arthur Smith, Alexander Calder, Georg Jensen, Monica Castiglioni,
Natalie Joy, Melinza Fernando, Misho, to name a few. What role do you think social media
plays in fashion today? Social media has dramatically increased connectivity for designers
and consumers alike. Designers have near limitless access to learning and inspiration and
we are able to connect on a personal level with a much wider range of consumers. This, I
feel, has greatly improved the quality of design in fashion. What is your favourite part
about being a designer? Being in a constant state of learning and experimentation andfinding like-minded people who share in my passion for design, craft and jewellery. How do
you want women to feel when wearing your jewellery? I want anyone wearing my jewellery to
feel like a piece of art that is a true expression of themselves. Tina Edward Gunawardhana

life_fashion90_24_Dressing_Well_in_Heat_or_Humidity_The_Art_of_Layering_an_Out.pdf,"Dressing Well in Heat or Humidity: The Art of Layering an Outfit, even in Sri
Lanka
Aug 27 2024. Layering is often associated with colder weather, but it can be a game-
changer for men in warm climates. It could be the perfect subterfuge if you have something
to hide, or just dress a little better than your peers at a simple dinner or function. The
key is to balance style and comfort, ensuring you look cool without overheating. Here’s
how to master the art of layering while staying stylish and comfortable. Start with the
Right Foundation The foundation of any layered outfit is crucial. In an outdoor setting,
opt for lightweight, breathable fabrics like viscose shirts or solid colour lightweight
t-shirts. These materials allow for better air circulation or dry fast, keeping you cool.
It goes without saying that since your outfit has a few more coming on, you could skip the
traditional vest most Sri Lankans decide to wear with even a plain t-shirt in this case.
Live dangerously, let it all out just this once. Incorporate Open Weave Fabrics When
layering in warm weather, the weight and breathability of your layers are paramount. Look
for fabrics like linen shirts, and lightweight wool. These materials are not only
breathable but also help in moisture management. Open weave fabrics, such as seersucker or
madras, are excellent choices for layering in hot climates. These fabrics have a loose
weave, allowing more air to pass through and keeping you cooler. A seersucker blazer or a
Madras shirt can add a stylish layer without adding too much warmth. The delicate balance
of Dark vs. Light Colours Dark colours absorb more heat, making you feel warmer. Stick to
light colours like white, beige, pastels, and light blues. These colours reflect sunlight
and help keep you cool. Obviously, might not be the best idea to follow this plan for a
nighttime look as it would draw attention to yourself, and make you look casual in a
dressy situation. I’ve noticed a black tee over a dark layer jacket or shirt has a
slimming effect when worn during the dark hours. Layer with Lightweight Outerwear A
lightweight jacket or blazer can be a great addition to your layered look. Look for
options made from breathable materials like linen or lightweight cotton. A linen blazer
can add a touch of sophistication to your outfit without making you overheat. For a more
casual look, a lightweight cotton jacket or a chambray shirt can work wonders. Keep It
Loose Tight clothing can trap heat and make you feel warmer. Opt for looser fits that
allow air to circulate. A loose-fitting Cuban collar shirt or a short-sleeved shirt with
interesting detail, texture or pattern over a t-shirt is quite in trend. Ensure that your
layers are not too baggy, as this can look sloppy. Aim for a comfortable, relaxed fit that
still looks polished but effortlessly stylish. Layer with Purpose Each layer should serve
a purpose, whether it’s adding style, providing sun protection, or helping with moisture
management. Be intentional with your layering choices. For example, a lightweight cotton
shirt can protect your skin from the sun while adding a stylish element to your outfit. A
breathable undershirt can help manage sweat and keep you feeling fresh. Experiment and
Have Fun Layering in warm climates can be a fun way to experiment with different styles
and looks. Don’t be afraid to try new combinations and see what works best for you. Mix
and match different fabrics, colours, and styles to create a look that’s uniquely yours.
Layering in warm climates like Asia is all about balancing style and comfort. By choosing
the right fabrics, colours, and fits, you can create stylish, layered outfits that keep
you cool and comfortable day or night. Remember to stay hydrated and have fun
experimenting with different looks. There is this false belief you need to be Gen-Z to
really pull off these looks, but a man of any age should be able to experiment and try a
new style that works well for him, and the right colours can carefully manage any age
impressions an outfit might give. If all else fails, call a stylist you can trust, or a
friend who’s got a great eye for a second opinion. Hopefully, it’s not your mother; she’s
too biased for the right opinion. A fashion stylist with a decade of experience as animage expert and consultant to local retail brands, Gayantha offers candid advice to men

new 2017 Relaxed Season Collection at a pop-up store at the Prana Lounge at 60, Horton
Place, Colombo 7, over the weekend of April 1 and 2. Lately, linen is simply part of the
palette of global fashion, as easy to encounter on the streets of Colombo as New York. The
linen trend really stems from our growing obsession with everything organic. We want to be
healthy, eat clean and cut out anything processed or chemical. It's only natural then,
that this is reflected in our fashion. Linen just is. It doesn’t get in the way. It’s the
perfect medium through which to live unencumbered. It's cool, light and literally screams
wear me when it’s hot! Linen and Life can be credited with introducing the concept of
luxury linen clothing to our sunny shores and its success has garnered a loyal fanbase as
well as an inevitable host of imitators. Known for their elegant, simple shapes and
inspired colours, the new 2017 Relaxed Season Collection from Ramona Pulle and Linen &
Life offers some great vibrant, fresh colours like rich peaches, pinks and turquoise as
well as beiges, off-white shades and denim with styles perfect for the traditional holiday
season in Sri Lanka. Designed to be easy and just slip-on, the styles offer comfort and
style and are constructed of high quality Irish and Italian linen as well as the softest
Madagascan cotton. These fabrics not only offer durability (of course the huge amount of
attention to detail L&L put into production and stringent quality control contributes to
this) and allow for an excellent fit and finish, they are also soft on your skin,
breathable and will help keep you cool during our regularly hot and humid tropical days in
Sri Lanka. Their new collection includes A-Line and sheath silhouettes, relaxed pants,
tunic tops, shorts and boat necked dresses in a range of sizes to accommodate the petite
to the plus sized. For men they offer a great collection of shirts that are a finely
curated mix of day and evening wear options. However you take your linen at the L&L pop up
store, just remember there is nothing better on a balmy Colombo night than a linen dress
and a lychee martini. Your comment (*)",2450

life_fashion90_24_The_Story_Of_La_Vivente__A_socially_conscious_apparel_brand.pdf,"The Story Of La Vivente: A socially conscious apparel brand
Aug 24 2023. Many individuals have taken it upon themselves to empower fellow citizens in
various capacities. La Vivente, a trending apparel brand has a similar story. Its founder
Dr. Dilesha Perera, aims to empower women in the outskirts of Colombo by providing them
with employment opportunities. In an interview with Daily Mirror Life, Dr Perera spoke
about how the brand came into being, her aspirations to empower women in the country and
why parents should encourage their children to follow their passion. Excerpts : Q TELL US
ABOUT YOURSELF.. I initiated my journey in the retail sector while I was at university.
During this period, I engaged in procuring stock lots, which I then distributed to
prominent retailers across the island. In 2005, fate led me to meet my husband, who, like
me, was a banker. Together, in 2007, we embarked on a new endeavour: manufacturing. Our
banking background unveiled a concerning trend—people faced hurdles in securing bank loans
due to a lack of collateral. This observation catalyzed our decision to shift our focus.
In 2016, I left my banking career to dedicate myself entirely to this venture. In due
course, we introduced a micro-entrepreneur programme with the goal of empowering women
within the country. Our initiative involved identifying individuals possessing sewing
skills. We provided the designs to them and guaranteed a market while they executed the
sewing for us. By equipping them with necessary machinery or other requirements, we
enabled them to launch their own businesses. To date, our efforts have resulted in
collaborating with over 20 micro-entrepreneurs, generating approximately 300 employment
opportunities. Q WHAT IS THE STORY BEHIND THE BRAND LA VIVENTE? The inception of the brand
La Vivente took place just before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our operational
model involved collaborating with various retail chains, and our workflow was intricately
tied to their orders. This setup presented challenges, as we were obligated to provide
work for our micro-entrepreneurs irrespective of order fluctuations. To address this
dilemma, we strategized a shift and transitioned into the realm of retail. This marked the
birth of the La Vivente brand. The name “La Vivente,” meaning ‘the living’ in Italian, was
chosen purposefully to mirror our vision of enabling livelihoods for our entrepreneurs.
However, shortly after we embarked on this new path, the pandemic emerged, temporarily
shuttering the market. In response, we swiftly pivoted to online sales, commencing with a
modest order volume that gradually gained momentum. The timing aligned with the shift in
consumer behaviour from offline to online, and our product line, marked by its
affordability and cultural fusion in design, resonated well with market demands. In 2020,
we inaugurated our first store in Galle, followed by subsequent openings in Koswatte and
Negombo in 2021, driven by meticulous research. The year 2022 witnessed the establishment
of our fourth store in Kandy, succeeded by another in Colombo this year. Our footprint
extends beyond borders, encompassing Australia, New Zealand, and the UAE. Our achievements
have not gone unnoticed. We proudly secured the esteemed ‘Best SME Local Brand’ Gold Award
and clinched the Bronze Award for Best New Entrant Brand at the SLIM Brand Excellence
Awards. Notably, our digital presence garnered recognition, as we secured the BestWeb.lk
Gold Award for the best SME website in 2022. Moreover, in 2022, I was honoured with the
title of Asia’s Most Outstanding Women Marketer of the Year by the Asia Marketing
Federation. Q HOW ARE THE MICRO ENTREPRENEURS SELECTED FOR THE WORKFORCE? We receive
inquiries from interested individuals, to whom we subsequently provide a sample task. This
enables us to assess their sewing capabilities in alignment with our quality standards.
Following this initial evaluation, we offer guidance and support. Often, they come
accompanied by one or two colleagues. Our process begins with a skill assessment, followed
by an evaluation of their potential to establish independent enterprises. Q HOW IS LA
VIVENTE DIFFERENT FROM OTHER CLOTHING STORES? La Vivente stands out for its commitment to
empowering women and nurturing their growth. We are not just a fashion brand; we are acommunity that supports and celebrates women in all their endeavours. Our clothes are not
just about looking good; they symbolise empowerment and confidence. Q THE APPAREL SECTOR
IS ONE OF THE MAIN INCOME GENERATORS IN THE COUNTRY. TELL US ABOUT THE CONTRIBUTION MADE
BY LA VIVENTE. Certainly, La Vivente has significantly contributed to the apparel sector,
serving as a noteworthy income generator within the country. Our impact is twofold, i.e.
economic empowerment for micro-entrepreneurs and a distinct presence in the market. La
Vivente has pioneered a micro-entrepreneur programme that has transformed the lives of
numerous individuals. By identifying individuals with sewing skills and providing them
with opportunities to start their own businesses, we have directly contributed to income
generation at the grassroots level. Our support encompasses design, pattern-making, and
the provision of necessary machinery. This initiative has resulted in the establishment of
over 20 micro-entrepreneurs who are now creating employment opportunities for themselves
and others. These entrepreneurs not only contribute to their household incomes but also
contribute to the overall economic growth of the country. La Vivente has pioneered a

These entrepreneurs not only contribute to their household incomes but also contribute to
the overall economic growth of the country. In summary, La Vivente’s contribution to the
apparel sector encompasses not only economic gains through entrepreneurship but also the
enhancement of the market’s diversity and appeal. Q HAVE YOU CONSIDERED INVOLVING THE
YOUTH IN YOUR VENTURE? Absolutely, involving the youth has been a core focus of our
venture at La Vivente. Recognizing the energy, innovation, and fresh perspectives that the
younger generation brings, we have taken deliberate steps to engage and empower them. On a
personal level, I actively foster entrepreneurship within the university to ignite
enthusiasm among the younger generation. Our initiatives encompass various engagement
avenues, including buddy programmes and sponsorships for university events like fashion
shows. Notably, we recently collaborated with a prominent local designer to provide
training for undergraduates, equipping them to participate in a fashion show. This
experience not only showcased their talents but also exposed them to real-world industry
dynamics. For those pursuing fashion design in universities, we extend internship
opportunities within our stores. This hands-on experience allows them to bridge the gap
between classroom learning and practical application, fostering their growth within the
fashion sector. By engaging with university students and cultivating their interest in
entrepreneurship and fashion, we contribute to their personal and professional
development, while also nurturing a future generation of creative minds. Q FASHION
DESIGNING IS A CAREER PATH THAT IS IN HIGH DEMAND TODAY. WHAT IS YOUR MESSAGE TO PARENTS?
Parents should empower their children to pursue their passions and become the individuals
they aspire to be. Providing support for their chosen paths enables them to achieve
greater success. It’s important to recognize that fashion designing is a specialized
career that may not be suitable for everyone. However, for those with an inclination,
there exists a multitude of opportunities. Fashion design resonates with a universal
appeal, as it taps into something that resonates with people on a personal level. By
fostering an environment that encourages the pursuit of passions, we enable our youth to
unlock their potential and contribute meaningfully to various fields, including the
captivating world of fashion. PICS BY Pradeep Pathirana A psychology graduate who

which showcased the amazing design prowess of Kavita. The show had five segments which
were titled Celestial Beauty, The Greecian Goddess, The Mogul Rajput Era, The Gatsby and
The Finale. Using a combination of silks, chiffons, satins and brocades, Kavita had
created some exquisite looks which features embellishments and embroidery. Inspired by
stories, tales and fables from the mythological past and love stories from different eras,
the fashion show transported the audience through the various ages in a variety of
silhouettes which darted from conservative to daring. Diminutive Kavita is a design
powerhouse; within the course of 16 weeks she had created 95 spectacular looks which she
presented at the fashion show. Saris, cocktail dresses, lengas , trouser suits and shalwar
kameez suits formed the mainstay of her collection. Jewel box colours of ruby red,
emerald, sapphire blue and pink along with pastel shades and dazzling white were sent down
the runway in varying silhouettes. Ethereal figures in embellished outfits dazzled as
Colombo gaped in amazement at the intricate and ornate embroidery and embellishing on the
outfits. Buoyed by the success of their first show together Kavita says “ I am so glad we
worked with an entirely local team on all areas of the production and I look forward to

Oct 30 2018. Nadia Gyi was recently crowned Facia Miss World 2018 and preparations have
begun to make her home country proud at the main pageant to be held in China this
December. A product of Colombo International School and the British School of Colombo,
Nadia had always dreamt of participating at the Miss World pageant. Nadia has a story of
ups and downs behind her charming smile but she believes that everything has worked well
in her life. The Daily Mirror Life sat down for a chat and here’s what she had to say : Q
: What do you do apart from modelling ? A : I’m Head of Digital Strategy at a tech start-
up that I founded with a group of friends. We are also involved in building online tools
and Apps. It’s pretty hectic to be working in a start-up but it’s a learning process which
you wouldn’t gain if you’re working for a normal company. It’s my friends who guided me
through the way and it’s more or less self-taught. I have also completed a course in
Digital Marketing and hope to pursue a degree in law once I return from China. Q: What
inspired you to participate in the pageant? A: Participating in the Miss World pageant was
a childhood dream that came true. I have been fascinated by how it allows women to go out
there and be themselves. Once I reached 18 I got the chance to participate. Q: How was the
experience with the pageant? A : At first it was a bit hectic because we had training
every day and we were also doing the Beauty with a Purpose project. We were a bit
overwhelmed at first but eventually, we got used to it. Q: Life after being crowned ... A
: It’s been busy and the response I get from people has been incredible. The followers on
my social media, my friends and family have continued to show their love. Q: The journey
so far… A: I have had a tough past because I lost my father at a young age. Somehow having
my sister by my side helped me to move through life. She has been my biggest support
system throughout the process. Everyone has their own story but it’s just a matter of
making the best out of what you have. So I’m thankful that everything has worked out well.
Q: How are you prepping for the main pageant? A: Similarly to the local pageant, it’s more
or less the same work that’s involved for the main pageant but on a larger scale. Dances
of Sri Lanka will be Dances of the World in the international pageant and we also have a
talent segment. The Beauty with a Purpose pageant plays a big role in terms of preparation
for the pageant. Besides that, I do my regular training with Tiron, Senaka and Kumar. Q:
Tell us about your project. A: The project that I have initiated is a rewards programme
for the military and for the veterans. It is a discount and a rewards programme island
wide across multiple industries. With this programme, an ex-military personnel or a
serving military official could walk into any store and redeem a discount on whatever
purchases they have. The goal is to get as many businesses as possible onto this platform.
We are working with the Ministry of Defence and hope we can succeed in this venture. The
project is currently in its implementation stage and we are in the process of discussing
with businesses etc . Q: The general perception of beauty pageants is quite negative. What
message do you have for the girls out there? A: Pageants are a platform for girls to go
out there and showcase their talents. The Miss World pageant focuses on doing a lot of
charity work. So I believe that this isn’t only about beauty but it’s also about what’s
behind the beauty. Q: What plans do you have on your return? A: After I return from China
I wish to further implement my project and try to contribute towards the wellbeing and
prosperity of Sri Lanka. Fun facts about Nadia Greatest fear: Geckos Favourite travel
destination in SriLanka: The Galle Fort Ideal holiday: Up in the mountains, in a little
tree house, reading a book, far away from the city Guilty pleasure : Salt (I’m a salt-
addict) Favourite hero : Princess Diana If you had three wishes in life, what would they
be? : I wish to fly, end poverty and meet Elon Musk If you got 24 hours to live what would
you do? Grab a rocket, take my family to another planet and come back. A psychology

Carnage - and I’m speaking to the man who founded the brand. It’s one thing to be fit,
it’s another thing to be fit enough to build a brand when the economy and the market were
totally against it all. Today the brand has grown and opened its new branch in Kandy; the
biggest yet to open. I spoke to him about his success story. When you took this decision
to start this brand, did you believe it would grow to be this today? Genuinely had no idea
what to expect or how the brand would grow over the past 3 years so the answer would be
no. How does it feel to have made a brand that the county is proud to wear, and what would
you say is the secret to success? There's always a sense of pride when people choose our
brand to wear for Training knowing that we are indirectly able to motivate more people to
commit to becoming healthier and fitter I Believe it is in our brand DNA to do better each
time which means that we had to constantly look at how we can improve which became the
secret to our success* Tell me about your expansion, how is the new Kandy store? Kandy has
always been a great part of our community and it naturally made sense for us to expand to
Kandy the welcome has been great so far. What would you tell those who have been following
you in creating similar products? Keep innovating and find what works for you. What were
your ambitions when you were growing up? As Weird as it is, being honest I can't recall
having one specific ambition. What’s new for your brand in 2024? We are expanding our
product range into a few other areas which I like to keep as a secret for now and Surely
We will be eying for a few exciting brand collaborations. What would you tell the youth of
today? Make sure to enjoy the Journey and build great relationships. Commit to your craft
and invest time and resources to learn new skills. Nothing can replace hard work and Hard
work is bound to pay off. Who or what inspires you? The fact that we have now built a Team
that depends on the success of the brand inspires me to keep going Danu is a Jaffna Boy

life_fashion90_25_Designer_1-2-1_Kasun_Gunawardana.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Kasun Gunawardana
Jan 28 2019. This young designer crossed our fashion radar a few years ago when he made
his debut at CFW as an emerging designer. Kasun has always striven to present clothing
that not only looks good but also has an interesting story. After a hiatus of a few years
from the fashion industry Kasun is back with a bang. A graduate of the AOD, Kasun’s new
offering is ‘Kasun x Content’ which is a ready to wear brand under the luxury brand KASUN.
The new collection was launched recently at Urban Island. Kasun x Content is made from
excess fabric sourced from the garment industry and produced by small scale local
production units. What is unique about this collection is that the clothes are gender
fluid and can be worn by both sexes. The collection is affordable and carries the design
aesthetic of KASUN. What are your brand's sustainability credentials – Kasun x Content
sources excess material from the garment industry. I still work with small scale
manufacturers, ethically produced without compromising on cost to improve and sustain the
livelihood of the manufacturers. How many pieces did you create for this collection? For
this particular launch I had 5 designs, and the sizing and structure allowed both men and
women to approach the brand. Tell us about the gender fluid aspect of this collection From
the beginning, my clothes were gender neutral, the silhouettes never restrict the wearer,
free sizes fit most clients, I always liked to push boundaries, even with myself. This
resulted in the collection being truly an example of gender fluidity. My clothes
complement the wearer as opposed to being a statement or a trend. The designs enhance the
wearer’s personality. How do you think Sri Lankan consumers will accept gender fluid
clothing? I see it in a perspective of intention. If I just wanted to sell the clothes, I
could have done two campaigns concealing the gender fluidity, and wouldn't have had much
of an impact as the designs are very simple and straight forward. I always carry a message
which gives people something to think about, and a message that is open to interpretation.
I was very fortunate to have a diverse clientele at the launch, who are from various
industries and backgrounds and who valued my work to give it a try. I like to arouse
curiosity and I think it also gives confidence to fashion students and future designers. I
wouldn't say the Sri Lankan consumer is the ideal approach, definitely consumers in
Colombo who have exposure to the creative industry would have more acceptance. Good things
happen to those who wait, I am patient and will continue to share my ideas. Tina Edward

life_fashion90_25_Designer_1-2-1_Maria_Domingos_and_Menusha_Gunawardhana.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Maria Domingos and Menusha Gunawardhana
May 18 2021. Bubu with its tagline of Find Your Beautiful is the creation of Creative
Designer Maria Domingos and Marketing specialist Menusha Gunawardhana. Launched in 2018
the brand specialises in making bags out of gunny sacks and rice sacks and develop a line
of handbags that can be viewed as both trendy and fashionable. Their sustainable elements
are many and the process also allows a cooperative of women to work from home, creating
the bags. The creations are sold at Kopi Kade, Seed Cafe and the Design Collective. What
sparked your interest in fashion design? MD : My mother was quite artistic, she was an
amateur artist and also an amazing seamstress. I grew up surrounded by her creative
endeavours so I think that sparked my interest in arts/fashion from an early age. What
made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? MD : My first foray into
anything creative was making jewellery. I love the Portuguese tile and so I started making
Portuguese tile-inspired jewellery which I then gave as presents to friends and family. It
received such positive feedback that some very dear friends of mine encouraged me to start
doing it as a business. Are you self taught or did you study fashion design? MD : Self-
taught How has your work evolved since you began your own label? MD & MG : I continued my
jewellery line but I was also thinking about doing something using materials that were
discarded or overlooked after their primary use. From there came the idea to work with
gunny sacks and rice sacks and develop a handbag line that could be trendy and fashionable
and elevate the beautiful colours and prints featured on the sacks. Are there any types of
Handbags that you avoid designing? MD & MG: I think creativity is limitless when designing
bags but my goal is to, as much as possible, creatively reuse materials so I purposely
avoid using materials that are not recycled. Where do you look for creative inspiration?
MD : I think living in Sri Lanka is like living in technicolour, there is always so much
colour, so much light so much art that it makes the senses very receptive so I can find
inspiration even just walking around. Describe your latest collection? MD & MG : Our
latest collection is showcasing the different gunny sack prints with their bold and
colourful designs and creatively reusing them into high street fashion quality products,
highlight the original purpose of the bags, what they originally carried, i.e. turmeric,
ginger or other species. The current collection comprises of: The Bubu bag - Every day,
smart/casual reliable tote bag. There is also a reversible version of this bag. The Bubu
Lite - It's a dainty shoulder bag with elastic handles, perfect to carry small items and
on the go. The Bubu Chic - An elegant, stylish and versatile handbag that can also double
as a weekend bag. The Bubu Rhombus - An unusual but eye-catching shoulder bag with its
interesting patchwork. The Bubu Mini - A crochet clutch bag made of paper thread and
removable handles for extra wear options. What materials are the bags created from? MD &
MG : We reuse the gunny sacks that are primarily used to carry spices as well as rice
sacks. The leather handles are a by-product of food production. Our logo is made from
reclaimed wood. The idea was to create a sustainable product from materials that would
otherwise end up as waste. What emboldened you to open a business during a pandemic? MG:
We had the product samples pre-pandemic both here and internationally and due to several
inquiries we had, we decided to launch at Kopi Kade, Seed Cafe and the Design Collective.
We felt these locations were in line with product esthetic. What is the USP of your line?
MG : Our product enables women to work from home and provide them with a second income.
What are your sustainability credentials? MG : All the materials are upcycled and given a
new lease of life. We are looking to achieve a sustainable transparent supply chain. What
is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your company? MG :
Identifying the right partners in the supply chain. Which international or local designers
are you inspired by? MD & MG : Buddhi Batiks, Lonali, Barefoot, Biasa, and most boutique
brands. What role do you think social media plays in fashion today? MG: It playssignificantly in creating awareness of the brand. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_25_Designer_1-2-1_Natalie_Cathryn_Goonetilleke.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Natalie Cathryn Goonetilleke
Nov 17 2020. Graduating from AOD with a degree in Graphic Design, Natalie’s underlying
passion veered towards fashion design. After graduating, Natalie took to the skies as an
air hostess using her international travel to learn more about fashion. Having launched
her brand Taprobana by Cathryn in 2019 with recycled batik accessories and sarongs,
Natalie is working on her new collection. A firm advocate in believing what she creates
and saying no to free design, Natalie works to her motto to consume less and create more.
WHAT SPARKED YOUR INTEREST IN FASHION DESIGN? I can’t exactly remember what sparked my
interest in Fashion Design. I believe it was a combination of a lot of things. As a child
I was always interested in art, it was my way of expressing my self. When I was a teenager
I embraced different subcultures like Punk and Emo. My mother and father are my favourite
fashion icons. I wore their vintage clothes giving it my own twist. I always knew I loved
design, but didn’t know what exactly I wanted to do. At the time I was interested in
Graphic Design so I completed my first degree in Graphics. Even though I loved Graphics I
had an equal interest for Fashion Design as well. To do another degree at the age of 19
without a job was not possible. So I became an air hostess and through my travels around
the world, I was inspired by different cultures and lifestyles that finally led me to be a
fashion designer. WHAT MADE YOU TAKE FASHION MORE SERIOUSLY AND MAKE A CAREER OUT OF IT? I
chose fashion more seriously as a career because it is something I like to do and I don’t
feel like I am working when I am doing it. Also, it’s always evolving and every time there
is something new to learn. HOW HAS YOUR WORK EVOLVED SINCE YOU BEGAN YOUR OWN LABEL? Since
I began the brand I have evolved to become a responsible designer who thinks sustainably
when designing. WHERE DO YOU LOOK FOR CREATIVE INSPIRATION? I take inspiration from almost
everywhere. Vogue Runway, WGSN, Hypebeast, Style Bubble and The Sartorialist are some
sites to name a few. Also, Sri Lankan culture and history play a main role and is one of
the sources that drive inspiration to my brand. DESCRIBE YOUR LATEST COLLECTION? The
latest Collection “Andare” is a resort wear collection, inspired by a Sri Lankan card pack
I created. The contemporary prints are inspired by Sri Lankan art and were hand drawn
before making the final screen, which gives it a unique touch. Each piece is designed for
comfort and is made for the island soul. “Andare” is a unique designer collection with an
interesting story to tell. This collection is a sustainable collection made from waste
fabrics and trims and I have worked closely with local batik artisans to bring out the
essence of Sri Lanka. WHO IS YOUR MUSE? She is a carefree soul that is confident, ready to
stand out and who is not afraid to try out new things. She embraces her culture and
heritage. She is an adventurous person who shows her personality in what she wears. WHAT
ARE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY CREDENTIALS? Taprobana is a sustainable brand that works with
minimal dyes, waste fabrics/trims and recycled products. Taprobana works with local
artisans to uplift the craft industry and aims to bring out the essence of Sri Lanka to a
modern platform. A percentage of the profits go towards humanitarian projects and animal
welfare. WHAT ARE YOU FASCINATED BY AT THE MOMENT AND HOW DOES IT FEED INTO YOUR WORK?
Currently, I am fascinated by how Sri Lankan ancestors used eco-friendly products in their
daily lifestyle. I am planning on working with a few products for future collections. WHAT
ROLE DO YOU THINK SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYS IN FASHION TODAY? Social media plays an important
role today where fashion brands use platforms like Instagram and Facebook for advertising
and it’s easier now to know about your target market. The consumer feels more connected
with the brand through social media, which helps to create networking opportunities. It
has also become a place where designers find inspiration for design solutions through
current situations happening around the world. WHAT IS YOUR FAVOURITE PART ABOUT BEING A
DESIGNER? Waking up every day to do what I love. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_25_Emerging_Designers_-_VATHSALA_GUNASEKARA.pdf,"Emerging Designers - VATHSALA GUNASEKARA
Feb 12 2018. Vathsala Gunasekara adopting Matara as home-town started up her primary
education at MR/ Kamburupitiya Maha Vidyalaya with a move towards her secondary education
at St. Thomas’ Girls’ High School Matara and Mahamaya Girls’ College Kandy. The passion
towards fashion helped her graduate as the batch topper with a first class Honours degree
in Bachelor of Design specialized in Fashion and Lifestyle under the Department of
Integrated Design at the University of Moratuwa with a personal style influence through
Bohemian, Minimal and Classical styles. FASHION EXPERIENCES What was the spark that paved
the interest in taking fashion more seriously to make a career out of it? I did my
A/Levels in the stream of Mathematics by getting selected for the Information Technology
side degree at the University of Moratuwa. The inspiring passion towards the creative side
led me to the pathway of changing my career into design from selected IT through a tough
decision helped me to stand up with confidence in the place where I wanted to sparkle
myself out seriously in becoming a well-known fashion designer through achieving the dream
of building up my own label. I personally believe the success behind my achievement is
taking part in Colombo Fashion Week held in 2016 when I was still an undergraduate brought
me the turning point in life from fashion design student to fashion designer with proper
guidance from the relevant professionals already out there in the field. How has your work
evolved since you began your own label? How would you describe your brand? The starting
and launching my brand when I was an undergraduate did not seem very easy to balance my
academics along with the development of my label, but the confidence that I had within
myself never led me down to the stage of giving up rather than the motivating myself to
work harder. Thus, after graduation, my full-time focus on the label helped me to evolve
gradually by adding new things by making my designs look even more creative day by day.
The inner belief of myself considering “Fashion has something to add value and comfort in
someone’s lifestyle” is all that I am showing through my label following a path of being
ethical and nature -friendly. The pieces designed by you has become more appealing to
people as a result how has it received international acceptance? One of my pieces retailed
at PR concept store was being purchased by a popular Bollywood Celebrity (Sonam Kapoor)
during her visit to Sri-Lanka and few invitations from foreign Fashion Weeks brought me
immense happiness and inner peace of satisfaction to realize that I have some capability
to touch the international acceptance from the locality What is your future motto in
another ten years of time? Are you superstitious or do you have any rules you live by? The
motto I wish to follow throughout my life is “Be true to yourself and follow your
conscience” is still helping me to reach the height of success with no doubt, in turn
making every moment cherished for my family, friends and well-wishers through a chance of
appreciation when they hear my name “Vathsala Gunasekara”. The only reason for this moment
is the principles which I follow greatly “I believe in goodness in people. I believe in
ethics. I believe in conscience.” Designer tip “Never give up on good opportunities you
get. Be good, do good; You will go to places” By- Harthika Ganeshan Your comment (*)",3476

Dec 15 2021. Today I feature Will By Zac and their amazing collection. I have been seeing
this brand for so long but I fell in love with it again as I walked in through those
doors. This is a brand that really screams Sri Lanka with everything light perfectly
stitched, it has a true island take to fashion. I also met the face and the personality
behind the Brand. I will say great things do come in small sizes, -Jennifer is not only a
wonderful person she really is trying to make the Lankans see the sleek stylish fashion. I
sat with this amazing person to have a small chat about the brand and her take on fashion.
What sparked your interest in fashion? Being an educator with a Master in Early childhood
education, it was my son who inspired me to take the first steps into the fashion
industry. Tell me about your collection which you have featured in this shoot? Which you
have featured in this shoot in Linen is a timeless and elegant fashion fabric. These are
simple but yet elegant timeless pieces that you can wear from morning to evening. What
better way rather than to be stylish and sustainable at the same time. Tell me about your
brand name and what did you want to leave back as a tread Mark for your brand? I wanted to
create a sustainable fashion brand that creates stylish and elegant pieces that would last
us a lifetime, and yet to be conscious and ethical in the process and that’s where the
brand name “Will by Zac” means walk-in linen love came about. Fashion is forever changing
and moving forward, do you think a more daring collection will move in our county?
Definitely, I strongly believe that a daring movement towards eco-conscious brands is the
way forward. As a designer how many pieces do you put out in every collection? Do you also
custom make? We don’t turn around new designs often as we want to encourage our customers
to be conscious of what they purchase. But we do manufacture our styles in demand How hard
is it to find the fabrics? How do maintain the quality? We sourced our fabrics from Taiwan
and China. These are mills that we have visited. So we know our suppliers and their
process well. What would you say is your personal style? What works best for me and my
personal choice of fashion and style would be comforted. So I love to create timeless
pieces in linen. What is the process of creating and marketing your design? Your design
inspiration? Minimalistic and beach vibe has always inspired me. And throughout our social
handles, we try to push the minimalistic approach right across the brand. Who do you
envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? We always
try to become an inclusive brand that has statement outfits for everyone. Are you self-
taught or did you study this shoe-making trade? I am self-taught I would say I am pretty
new to the industry. My personal goal has always been to think out of the box and this is
a personal goal I have set for myself. There is nothing impossible for you to achieve if
you truly believe in yourself and if you have a goal What’s new in the next few months? We
are expanding globally and we are super excited for the New Year. What’s the new
collection which is to be launched? The Christmas collection. Designer – Jennifer Von Hagt

Mar 20 2017. After four days of lively back to back fashion shows, the curtain came down
on the 14th edition of Colombo Fashion week last night. Celebrating Colombo was the theme
for HSBC Colombo Fashion Week 2017, and both the audience and as many designers as
possible celebrated Colombo through fashion. Fast emerging as a notable fashion week in
the Asian subcontinent, this edition of HSBC Colombo Fashion Week drew the most notable
fashion designers from Sri Lanka and across the seas to showcase their collections. The
final day of the Sri Lankan fashion calendar's most notable event was full of colour,
couture and decadence. Both emerging and established designers strove hard to present
collections that stayed true to their fashion ethos and judging by their collections, Sri
Lanka's fashion future is certainly on the ascend! ""Colombo Fashion Week by God's grace
has gathered momentum in leading the fashion design industry to new frontiers, a movement
that fathered revival for fashion in Sri Lanka is bearing fruits. Every year we learn,
gather feedback, implement and move on. 2017 was a new step up, done and dusted now on to
the next one. Design development among the new generation will be key."" said Ajai Vir
Singh, Founder of Colombo Fashion Week Agatha Ruiz de La Prada An explosion of colour hit
the runway as internationally acclaimed Spanish designer, Agatha Ruiz de La Prada’s
designs which have been shown in international fashion capitals of the world graced the
fashion runways in Colombo. As the opening act on the last day of Colombo Fashion Week,
Agatha’s summer collection is best described as fun and youthful with its vibrant colour
palette and remarkable detailing. An ensemble of flirty swimsuits added the finishing
touches to her vivacious collection. The designer behind the label, Sharmila Ruberu, draws
inspiration from the everyday woman. Her summer collection was inspired by the Greek
goddess Athena and displayed an ensemble that was elegant and vibrant with pleating
playing a dominant role in her collection. Pleated dresses formed the mainstay of her
collection in pastel hues with a pop of rich red as her showstopper. ""With Athena being
the inspiration behind my collection I think for me, this collection is the power of
femininity exemplified."" The award-winning brand CHARINI is an eco-luxury fashion brand
retailing in Sri Lanka, Europe, Australia and the USA. Her summer collection ‘Hexapoda
Couture’ gets inspiration from the anatomy and surface textures of insects. The collection
includes a mix of cotton blends and silks done in personally printed bold prints of
electric colours. Visually eye-catching in its colours and immaculately detailed, the
collection presented itself as edgy with a touch of eccentricity. ""Loose fitted
silhouettes are one of my main trend predictions for 2018 and I used abstract graphical
interpretations of insects and their anatomy to create a collection that compliments
curves."" Dimuthu Sahabandu Dimuthu Sahabandu is a contemporary Sri Lankan designer known
for producing one of a kind designs. His summer collection derived its inspiration from

evening gowns with delicate and intricate embroidery and beading presented itself in muted
colours of rich ivory and black. Decadent and lavish, Dimuthu’s collection showed skilled
craftsmanship in manipulating fabric and creating silhouettes which complemented and
accentuated the female form. ""This collection is a contemporary ready to wear collection
capturing the essence of Dutch and Portuguese eras of early Ceylon."" Launched in 2013,
MAUS is a brand that has a design philosophy of its own unique nature. The MAUS summer
collection presented itself as largely monochromatic with its muted black and white colour
palette. The block colours presented in loose, flowing silhouettes emphasized an
understated elegance that is timelessly fashionable. Together with the intricate
accessorizing by Papillon du Thé, the MAUS range of leather footwear of flat sandals and
mules added a certain va va voom to the collection. Neon makeup looks made a comeback on
the catwalk as Ponds BB+ presented Neons and Nudes, makeup looks inspired by the eclecticpop stars of the eighties. Hot pinks, electric blues and yellows dominated the looks which
were sent down the runway. Created by Ponds BB+ in collaboration with celebrated makeup
artist Pallavi Symons, the models sported a combination of colours which added dimension
to the models' faces. More suited the younger generation, the neon makeup looks gave
luminous a new definition! Abraham & Thakore The grand finale of Colombo Fashion Week was
presented by one of India’s most successful labels ‘Abraham & Thakore’. The summer
collection presented by David Abraham, Rakesh Thakore and Kevin Nigli was a monochromatic
collection of black in combination with white, silver and gold. Incorporating a key trend
of 2017, metallics took dominance as it presented itself in each design in various forms
of graphical prints and typography. An imaginative use of drapes, the collection was rich
in colour with many pieces of clothing that could transition from day to evening wear with
ease. Abraham & Thakore provided a fitting finale to the four day fashion extravaganza
that is HSBC Colombo Fashion Week. TEXT by Tina Edward Gunawardhana & Panchali Illankoon

life_fashion90_25_Metal_Pretty_with_Cher_by_Chevonne.pdf,"Metal Pretty with Cher. by Chevonne
Oct 12 2017. Adding luster to one’s personality, for a woman, remains of paramount
importance. This week, we shake off those traditional chunks for some new-age finery.
Caught in elegance, detail, and muted tones, the jewellery label Cher. is keen on
featuring wooden pieces - meticulously hand-crafted collections using locally sourced
materials and stones. The label suited for daily wear, is fresh; trimming smartly the
harshness of a gaudy mess where possible. According to Founder Chevonne de Soysa, this is
their ethos. Excerpts from an email interview are as follows: “The collection is a project
nourished by passion. I have always loved jewellery and accessories and the collection
began as a hobby and creative outlet. With Cher. by Chevonne, I have tried to create a
complete collection that includes fine everyday wear pieces as well as some designs which
are more distinctive in style to make a statement, be it a subtle or elegant one!.I design
pieces that I would like to wear and hope that others would too. I would like the
collection to offer timeless pieces that don’t quickly move in and out with current
trends.” Can you tell us about the name ‘Cher’ and what kind of woman it’s aimed at? What
led you to work with jewellery? Cher is my nickname, short for Chevonne. The collection is
a project nourished by passion. I have always loved jewellery and accessories and the
collection began as a hobby and creative outlet. With Cher. by Chevonne, I have tried to
create a complete collection that includes fine everyday wear pieces as well as some
designs which are more distinctive in style to make a statement, be it a subtle or elegant
one! Your creations evoke a collision of both worlds; subtle and solid. Has moving to Sri
Lanka from Australia sp arked any value conducive to design? I am grateful for having had
the opportunity to spend time in both Australia and Sri Lanka which has shaped my style
and design aesthetic. I would say my current collection may appeal more to the Australian
market, where there is a lot of value placed on unusual designs and use of unique
materials. In Sri Lanka, I feel the market is still a bit more traditional and the
appreciation for jewellery is through the value of the stones and the metal. However, I
believe this is gradually changing as there is more demand for wearable jewellery that
sits somewhere between costume and precious jewellery, which doesn’t necessarily have to
be locked away in a safe! We see that you’re influenced by natural elements? I do really
love neutral, earthy tones and textures, which carry through in my personal style as well
as in my home. I feel that they are timeless and soothing to the eye. They are also a good
base pallet to build on with colour and prints. My husband really helped me to appreciate
nature in its true form; he loves wildlife and is an amazing wildlife p hotographer, so we
spend a lot of time on safari, which gives me inspiration. Three favourite style icons
from the industry and why? Samantha Wills - an Australian jewellery designer who started
small, hand making jewellery on her kitchen table. She now has an international jewellery
empire. I love her collection and find her to be an inspiration as a business woman. Blake
Lively - I feel that her style is the perfect balance between edgy, chic and feminine. She
is always accessorised to perfection! And closer to home, Annika Fernando - I work with
Annika as our collection is stocked at her boutique, PR. I admire her for being able to
juggle many successful businesses as well as a family. What’s next? How do you envision a
future in keeping with fashion trends for your brand? I have to admit that I am not the
most up-to-date with following fashion trends; I design pieces that I would like to wear
and hope that others would too. I would like the collection to offer timeless pieces that
don’t quickly move in and out with current trends. Your comment (*)",3979

Jan 26 2023. Today the Buzz I'm talking about something very special to me. When the
country was crumbling and when some were being demotivated, there was one person with a
bright young team who started building a brand called Carnage. This brand grew to be THE
brand for active wear and lifestyle. This only proves when you keep pushing, you achieve.
Joel is too humble and never wanted his name mentioned, but behind every strong brand,
there is one person who is burning the night lamp. If you have not tried Carnage, you must
for the fact it’s done by US for US - all local. Even the models have become personalities
because of the style and consistency. Today they stand tall with a flagship store in
Bamabalpitiya. Your team started this brand during the height of the pandemic, why did you
take such a challenge? The fact that we were in the middle of a pandemic wasn't something
we thought too much into. We were in a great space with opportunities opening up for a
High-quality local brand for active and lifestyle wear so we just wanted to make sure we
capitalize on that and go all in. What would you tell your brand of Carnage stands for?
Carnage stands for becoming the best version of yourself, may it be at the gym, outdoors,
workplace or wherever you are. It's making a promise and a manifestation through the
clothing you wear that you are committed to becoming the best version of yourself. How has
the new branch taken off? Amazing! and happy to finally open doors after being an online
brand What do you have on the shelves for someone who has no idea about this brand so they
get an idea? The highest quality of clothing and accessories for activewear and lifestyle.
What are the new products you hope to add? That's a secret that I'm not allowed to spill
but we are in the works of expanding our range 10x. Would you say this brand is ONLY for
the fit and fabulous? Can curvy people shop too? This brand is for everyone and we mean
it, regardless of your body type. We love creating pieces that can be styled by anyone and
any way they like. What would you tell young entrepreneurs, who are dreaming about
creating their own brand!? Start in whichever way you can, what matters is getting
started. Rest will fall into place as the journey moves forward. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with

life_fashion90_26_Completing_your_outfit_with_a_Navya_Clutch.pdf,"Completing your outfit with a Navya Clutch
Feb 19 2018. Sisters Munawara and Sulthana Cader, the creative force behind the clutch
purse brand Navya say, as a rule, they never put forward a clutch purse which they will
not carry themselves. This simple credo is probably why Navya clutches are attracting a
steady flow of happy customers within a short period of operation. The ladies behind Navya
share a few thoughts on what they consider to be the ultimate accessory. Their personal
favourites at the moment A raw silk, vibrant, floral print, square-shaped box clutch which
is versatile enough to be paired with an outfit combo as simple as jeans and a white
t-shirt or a black cocktail dress. A modern city silhouette print on raw silk with a
vintage, sleek frame, picked from Navya’s Valentine Collection. This could be worn with a
trendy outfit for a Girls’ Night Out or even a casual Sunday brunch. A square box clutch
featuring exquisite hand embroidery and intricate beading which can only be worn as a
perfect accessory with a sari or evening gown for an elegant affair. This clutch is part
of Navya’s handmade luxe edition clutches. Selecting a suitable clutch for an outfit The
first consideration is what purpose the clutch will serve within the look you want to
build for yourself. There are always two things a clutch can do.It can make a statement by
itself or simply compliment the chosen attire to give it some extra punch. Usually, a
statement clutch featuring vibrant colours, heavy beadwork or intricate embroidery is
paired with a very simple monochrome outfit making the clutch purse the crowning jewel of
the outfit. The clutch purse which is intended to complement an outfit usually strikes a
chord with the attire worn in terms of colour, texture and print etc. Popularity of the
box clutch purse Browsing the Navya purse collection you will find that almost all are box
clutches. According to Munawara and Sulthana, while globally there are a variety of clutch
purse trends taking shape, they find that square or rectangular box clutches are a
favourite among their clientele in Colombo. Navya did feature round, oval and envelope
clutch initially but with the high demand for box clutches, they now focus more on various
box clutch variations. While the Box clutch is super chic and elegant to carry, most often
ladies find it’s rigid frame and shape stifling especially if you want to carry some basic
items for a night out like a phone, credit cards and a tube of lipgloss. As a start-up
brand, Navya is constantly in touch with their customers and their feedback goes right
back into the designs they put forward. Navya’s 8 inches by 4-inch box clutch can easily
carry a phone and a few essential items which is another reason why the design is a
favourite. The brand will however soon venture beyond its box clutches and is preparing to
launch a new rectangular shape and a pouch type clutch in the near future. Clutch purse
trends for 2018 Trending now, are purses with prints ranging from abstract, watercolour,
floral and even local feature prints. In terms of shapes, squares and rectangles are in
vogue and the box frames are getting thicker. While the clutch purse is a night out
staple, it is not uncommon to find jeans and t-shirt combination being completed with an
elegant clutch. Especially abstract- quirky prints can easily be worked into a casual
outfit. A closer look at Navya Navya is a hobby turned business venture for Munawara and
Sulthana. While holidaying abroad, they found some clutch purses they absolutely adored,
and later on looked around in Colombo hoping to purchase something similar with no
success. They identified a niche which seemed lucrative and a subject matter which was
personally very exciting for them and with that combination they launched their very own
clutch purse brand Navya. Navya currently operates exclusively as a Facebook and Instagram
store with plans for their own online store in 2018. Each Navya clutch is unique as they
do not manufacture or source more than one or two purses from each fabric. They also
retail via regular pop-up sales and at the design collective store. ' Text by Surekha

Oct 17 2017. Model, medical student, aspiring pilot, cabin crew and fashion designer,
these are just a few of the different roles that Tashiya has embarked on before settling
down to be a fashion designer. Juggling her role as a stewardess and as a designer,
Tashiya launched her label, ‘Chattalé’, which provides designer wear for women who love to
stand out. What made you embark on a career in fashion? My mother and her late sister.
They use to make clothes from beeralu to batiks and their timeless sense of fashion up to
now and the way they use to dress me up influenced me. Name of your label? The name of my
label is “Chattalé”. It’s an exclusive designer wear label for women who love to stand
out, currently focused on casuals to evening wear. All these pieces including the
materials are specially crafted by us for chattalé and handmade with love. I admit the
fact that most of these pieces shows off my personality, my obsession for flowers and
handwork. And I love seeing my customers wearing them. Describe the new collection? Ever
since I launched chattalé the idea was to have 2 couture collections a year. I also want
to do a general collection to include family t-shirts and some casual clothing. What
are the challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri Lanka? Certainly there
are lots of ups and downs but in short the most challenging aspect for me is the start.
Building up the brand, creating things with unique elements to engage with the
competition. I’m honestly not trying to be a part of the commercial industry where you
will see our product everywhere in town. With all the designer labels coming up brands
have to be different. You could even see from our first collection “Grace” all our
materials were different to what is usually seen. Where do you retail your stuff? Chattalé
is currently retailed at RAMP Liberty Plaza. We started online through Facebook. We will
indeed have a flagship store soon. However we will continue to have it online in future
too. We are planning to have a few pop-up stalls. Your top fashion tip? “DRESS IMPECCABLY
AND THEY WILL REMEMBER YOU FOR THE REST OF THER LIFE” Where do you like to shop in Sri
Lanka? As a person who travels pretty much the whole month I have hardly had the
opportunity to pick a wardrobe from here. I think I love what I’ve got from Barefoot and
Arienti. What next? My next step will be to carry out more simple things. I will use lots
of nude colours - simple, comfortable but elegant. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

life_fashion90_26_Designer_1-2-1_Kasun_Gunawardana.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Kasun Gunawardana
Sep 07 2021. In 2015, Kasun Gunawardana burst onto the fashion scene when he showcased his
collection at Bright Sparks, the launch pad for young designers at Colombo Fashion Week.
His quest to create sustainable fashion at a time when the concept was new to Sri Lankan
fashion aficionados was admirable. However for awhile after that, Kasun went off the
fashion radar until he emerged recently with a new collection launched under a new label
called Kasun X Content. The new pret a porter collection is completely created with a
heavy slant on sustainability and his designs are gender fluid. As a designer Kasun is
committed to his beliefs and is deeply dedicated to creating clothes which do not comprise
on quality. As Founder and Designer at KASUN, I have created two labels, ’KASUN’ and
‘CONTENT’. What sparked your interest in fashion design? My mother. As far as I remember,
since I learnt to communicate I was given creative freedom by her from choosing her
clothes to gifts, homeware, and decor and I had the liberty of choosing my own wardrobe. I
was always fearless. I was sheltered and protected so no one could have an opinion. I
could live my imaginations the way I wanted to. And clothing was more my language. What
made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? As I grew up, I was
oppressed from expressing my creative self. I was pressured into the education system by
society, and by adults who couldn’t see a future or gender appropriation in this industry.
Furthermore, I was a victim of bullying by peers that left me with no voice. So I decided
I am going to give them a show, studied mathematics for my A/L’s, prove to them that I am
smart, and silently gained knowledge about fashion through the internet, and watching
shows such as Ugly Betty that had a huge impact on me as a teenager, as the character
Justin in the show was going through exactly what I was, so my confidence developed with
his character I would say. So I knew for sure, always forever, that I would speak the
language of clothing, so I received permission from my father to send me to study Fashion,
At Lasalle College Of The Arts, Singapore, where I brought back knowledge from and
concluded my BA at The Academy of Design. How has your work evolved since you began your
own label? I started KASUN as a completely sustainable luxury fashion brand in 2015. My
clothing was all handwoven, some naturally dyed, and was contemporary ready to wear for
all genders. But being so new and in the centre of attention I was distracted, I derailed
for a while and there was a long hiatus. I relaunched as KASUN X CONTENT in 2018 which is
Prêt-à-Porter brand. While both labels share similar aesthetics and design elements,
CONTENT garments are carefully crafted using surplus fabric from major factories. As a
result, CONTENT pieces are affordably priced and accessible to mid-market customers. Are
there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? Well many actually such as
sportswear and winter clothes, definitely nothing that has to do with animal cruelty. I
would love the chance to dress a bride and a groom, and even red carpet looks with my own
element to it. Where do you look for creative inspiration? It’s everywhere, I keep my
living space all white, so I can imagine more, and absorb less. So I am typically
imagining and the feelings that come through it I translate into clothing. As I said, it
is a language, so it’s an expression of my state of mind. Describe your latest collection?
The latest was designed for a special client and a dear friend who commissioned me to make
him a custom wardrobe. I was starved of designing, and I wanted to dare to be
multidisciplinary with no previous experience. I worked with both handloom and off-the-
shelf fabrics. I made pieces with hand-painted batik art stories such as an ancient
drawing replica of a musician playing the flute, using wall art references from ancient
kingdoms. It was a custom make resort wear capsule collection. It included drawstring
shorts, made using those said prints and I designed sleek shirts that had these stories
patched on to as well. And the most special part of it is the buttons. The buttons on the
cuff were handcrafted sliver with gemstones embedded. Overall, it was a visual feast for aminimalist. And I think my idea of minimalism was limited to colour before, but as I’ve
evolved I see minimalism as a lifestyle with many facets, a minimal yet glamorous is now
how I see it, because, luxury-wear is slow-fashion, I get to be sustainable, socially
responsible and cruelty-free. Who is your muse? Long story short, I watched Stargate at
the age of 4, where this gender-neutral Egyptian pharaoh played by Jaye Davidson, really
opened my imagination. That a man can be everything at the same time and it was so
glorious and it brought me contentment and fascination. His character really inspired my
personal style always. And as I started design school I was following the great Yohji
Yamamoto, and similar brands where I learnt to deconstruct, create flow and volume and
ease, in garments. What are your sustainability credentials? I have not received any
formal recognition, but almost all the time, at least one or many of the following such as
social responsibility, ethical production, local craftsmanship, eco-fashion comes to play.
And I really don’t seek credentials, I just want to learn to make clothes the most
sustainable and creative way I am able to and share them with my audience. What are you
fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? Well, let’s just take a
very relevant example, the pandemic has now swallowed 1.5 years of our potential growth,
but it has also opened up a new way of lifestyle. People still celebrate and socialize,
but more privately and intimately where resort-wear and redefined loungewear have become
necessary. So this opening in the market has aligned with my brand so perfectly that I can
design for both KASUN and CONTENT with great faith. What is the biggest lesson that you
have learned since you started your company? Never compromise your self-worth, and don’t
be a pushover. When you have passion, money is the side effect. So always keep in mind
that passion first, and the more you’re passionate, money will manifest. What role do you
think social media plays in fashion today? EVERYTHING, word of mouth, and fashion being
sectioned to only magazines and the elitist network was building walls too high. Now you
get to express your creativity and be rewarded, and you learn from each other. Hence, I
really appreciate brand transparency, so we are conscious and become more ethical and
that’s why if social media is used with the correct intention, it could change consumerism
for the better. How do you want women to feel when wearing your clothes? I don’t want to
decide for them, it’s all in the wearer. Sometimes it totally resonates with my identity,
sometimes there are different takes and I appreciate it. And if you go on my Instagram
@wearcontent, it is evident that the same clothes have been worn by different genders and
body types so that freedom is essentially what I want everyone to feel. Pix courtesy Kasun

life_fashion90_26_Designer_1-2-1_Zainab_Summaiya_and_Tasneem_Zaheen.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Zainab, Summaiya and Tasneem Zaheen
Jul 27 2021. Founded by three sisters, this eclectic brand offers products that are
beautifully crafted with attention to detail. Using raw materials which are ethically
sourced or upcycled the brand's motive is to help create employment for men and women who
are then able to support and empower their local communities. The brand also advocates a
zero-waste policy and focus heavily on sustainability. Name of brand: Mint Ceylon What
sparked your interest in fashion design? Coming from a long line of artists and designers
in our family and having parents that are also in the creative field, I think design has
always been inbuilt in us. We have always had a creative eye for things. Fashion has
always played a part in our lives. Ever since we were young we would get our clothes sewn
because we each had our own styles and couldn’t always find it in stores. This encouraged
us to try new things and be more creative. In order to design an idea or concept we have
to understand how things worked, so it’s like a creative journey from idea to final
product and this has always been something that we wanted to pursue. Pictured: Zainab What
made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? We observed a lot of
fast fashion brands that were emerging in the market and what we realized was that there
is a huge gap in the upcycled fashion industry. The three of us are not new to upcycling,
we often visit thrift shops and figure out ways we can manipulate garments into something
new and fresh which gave us the idea to start Mint Ceylon. During the first lockdown, the
three of us got to talking about how we can take this first step in the upcycled community
and from there it was all about working 24/7 on this dream of ours to make it a reality.
Are you self-taught or did you study fashion design? So to give you a bit of a background
about us, Zainab has a degree in Interior Design and owns her own jewellery line called
Zirc Jewellery. Summaiya is a self-taught successful makeup artist and hairstylist under
the name of Avoura Artistry and is also a self-taught Graphic Designer and Tasneem is a
Fashion Designer, a graduate of AOD. We combined all of our strengths and make a great
team. How has your work evolved since you began your own label? We are always looking out
to improve ourselves with each collection that we launch. We often come up with new ideas
and products to test out the market and we are glad that it has been doing well so far.
Are there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? The great thing about a brand
being run by three sisters is the fact that we all have three different styles and we tend
to keep an open mind when designing our products and not limit ourselves to only one type
of clothing or product. Where do you look for creative inspiration? Thanks to technology
we have access to so much information at our fingertips at the comfort of our home. Each
of us has a sketchbook where we write down our ideas or draw sketches. Our heads usually
run with a million ideas when we look at all of the cut pieces and dead stock. I think
it’s the materials that usually speak to us and give us creative direction and help bring
our sketches to life. Describe your latest collection? Since we are a fashion and
lifestyle brand, our collections are a bit of everything from handloom to block print. Our
current collection is a capsule collection with homage to handloom, an industry governed
largely by women, the Sri Lankan heritage and traditional weaving patterns are kept alive
in with a modern twist. This collection is colourful and vibrant and consists of soft
handloom cotton handcrafted into effortless Kimonos, kimono tops and our signature
painters shirts. Who is your muse? I think the everyday woman has to be our muse because
we draw inspiration from and design for the everyday woman with different personalities
and body types. Pictured: Summaiya What are your sustainability credentials? Mint Ceylon
is a homegrown fashion and lifestyle brand providing up-cycled products and clothing using
zero waste techniques of production. We up-cycle fabric scraps from garment exporters and
tailoring units in Sri Lanka and turn them into contemporary fashion products like
clothing, shoes and bags. The fabric products designed are aimed at bringing handmade andhigh-quality sustainable alternatives to plastic or high intensive less ethical
production. We are an all women-owned brand and our products are made by women from rural
communities. All products are designed by us three sisters turning deadstock and discarded
fabrics into vibrant products with the help of our highly talented and skilful artisans
from around Sri Lanka. What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into
your work? We are always inspired and fascinated by the upcycled fashion industry and we
are looking for different and interesting ways to incorporate Sri Lankan handicrafts and
our Sri Lankan heritage into our new collections. What is the biggest lesson that you have
learned since you started your company? To go with the flow, sometimes things are not
going to work out the way you have planned but you need to learn to adapt to all kinds of
situations. It is important to keep being creative and innovative in this industry and to
always be willing to keep yourself updated with all the latest advancements in the
sustainable industry and find ways to incorporate them into our business. How did you
scale your business during COVID-19? The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the
way we live, work, and do business. Going the extra mile to support our artisans, during
the pandemic we kept our artisans busy with creating capsule collections and making sure
the women we work with had steady fair wages. We also focused on the value we give to our
customers, many people are watching their spending right now, made sure our products were
upcycled and had a story which bought value to each piece and we upped our social media
presence and post relevant, educational and engaging content. What’s your motto? Buy less,
choose well, make it last. Which international or local designers are you inspired by?
Female powerhouse Indi Yapa Abeywardana. She has worked hard from the get-go and supports
local artisans and designers alike. Her dedication, never-give-up attitude and passion,
willpower is something we aspire to be someday. Few other local designers that inspire us
are Nayani, her brand is known for its simplicity, elegance, fine fabrics and contemporary
silhouettes with unique design elements. Lonali upcycles pre-consumer fabric discards and
transforms them into original clothes and lifestyle products. As for international
designers, Patagonia has been paving the way forward in the ethical fashion space since
1973. The outdoor wear brand started using recycled plastic bottles to make their garments
back in 1993. Antiform is an English brand based in Bristol. The brand takes reclaimed
materials and mix them with traditional heritage crafts. Pictured: Tasneem What role do
you think social media plays in fashion today? Social media has made a huge impact on
brands especially since the start of the pandemic more brands have focused on their online
presence in social media as it is their main source of interaction with consumers and as a
means of networking with others in the industry. In the fashion world, social media has
brought connectedness, innovation, and diversity to the industry. Even the world’s largest
news agencies have had to transform the way their readers digest the news, adding social
media platforms to the forefront of their news deliveries. Social media has done a number
of incredible things for the fashion industry, including creating fashion icons, fashion
movements and also heavily influencing fashion trends. We as brands need to utilize social
media to be more responsible and create more awareness of everything that happens around
us. What is your favourite part about being a designer? Coming up with concepts for new
collections and digging through all of the scrap materials, preparing them for new
collections, putting a smile on our customer’s faces knowing that we have contributed in
some way towards making the world a better place. How do you want women to feel when
wearing your clothes? We want women to feel empowered and take on the world when wearing
our pieces. I think empowerment is all about confidence and fashion is an amazing tool to
reflect that. We want women to realize that what they wear makes a huge difference not
just on how they’re perceived by others... but more importantly, on how they feel about
themselves. Feeling confident and happy impacts our wellbeing. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is

life_fashion90_26_Fashionably_Danu_-_LOVI.pdf,"Fashionably Danu - LOVI
Nov 20 2020. Today on Fashionably Danu, I wanted to check out the all-new collection from
LOVI. When our days are now mostly at home, keeping it simple is what we are looking for.
LOVI understands how to keep it easy and stylish at the same time, the summer colours and
buttonless shirts are just perfect. LOVI sarongs have been evolving over the years with
collections that match any occasion. These new pastel shades are ideal for any island
loving person - I just feel it’s a HAPPY collection with a sense of surprise. I sat with
the man himself Asanka de Mel to ask him more on this collection. Q TELL ME ABOUT THE NEW
PASTEL SHADES INSPIRED COLLECTION? The pastel sarongs are inspired by the greens and blues
of the oceans, the yellows and pinks of the Araliya flowers—these fresh colours are all
around us in nature. Can you believe it? Q WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS MISSING IN MEN’S FASHION
IN SRI LANKA? Confidence. Many are still hiding and following the pack. Q SINCE MANY OF US
ARE WORKING FROM HOME THESE DAYS, WHAT SHOULD WE BE WEARING? Let’s face it—it really does
feel better to get dressed for work in the morning, even if you are staying at home. The
LOVI collection with its matching shirts would be a great start. I can guarantee your
colleagues and friends on zoom will thank you for it. Q WHEN DID THE BEACH COLLECTION
START? WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IS YOUR FAVOURITE COLOUR IN THE COLLECTION? People traditionally
wear sarongs to the beach, but we wanted to expand on that. Now, the LOVI nautical, rugby
and check collections provide more than 20 different options for beach, poolside or your
get-out-of-the-city vacation. Q TELL ME ABOUT CFW THIS YEAR, AND THE COLLECTION YOU
SHOWCASED. HOW HAS THE FEEDBACK BEEN? Sri Lankan National suits. We wanted to breathe new
life into the national—with diversity in styles and occasions, for men, for women, in
colours, in luxury fabrics, in silk, in sophisticated cuts and with embroidery. Weare
thrilled with the response from CFW. Q I SAW SOME NEWS ABOUT LOVI CEYLON MOVING INTO
CORPORATE WEAR. TELL ME ABOUT THAT? We want our corporate leaders to represent Sri Lanka
with confidence and wear the national suit. We are bringing lots of options and
personalisation—refined suiting cuts, colours, fabrics, finishes, monogramming, custom
tailoring, express service, price points—the works to fit any corporate occasion from
Board meetings, award ceremonies, cultural events and of course, daily wear. We created so
much luxury and elegance in the new LOVI Nationals. There’s an infinite colour selection,
and the cuts are as sophisticated as Western suiting. Q HOW CAN ONE MIX AND MATCH YOUR
SHIRTS IF THEY WANT TO KEEP AWAY FROM SARONGS? Not sure why you would! But if you must
avoid the sarong, the shirts are made to fit perfectly with jeans and dress pants—tucked
in or out. You’ll get many compliments, guaranteed. Q LOVI HAS NOW MOVED FROM ONLY SARONGS
TO SHIRTS, AND NOW EVEN SHOES. TELL ME WHAT’S NEXT? Yes, we now have a full range of
shirts for both men and women, from party wear to working from home wear. Shhhh! We have
some surprises lined up and you’ll see these coming soon. Q TELL ME ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE
DRESSED ME IN TODAY? WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION AND STORY? The rugby shirt is the new
t-shirt. Great fit, no fuss, and it’s eco-friendly—it’ll last longer than your average
t-shirt, but has no elastic or polyester which pollute the environment. As for these
sarongs, you’ve been wanting to wear these colours for a long time, Danu! Q WHAT HAS
COVID-19 TAUGHT YOU ON A PERSONAL NOTE? Patience. Appreciate progress, even if it is slow.

life_fashion90_26_HSBC_CFW_Emerging_Designers_Showcase.pdf,"HSBC CFW Emerging Designers Showcase
Mar 15 2017. Showcasing Sri Lanka’s young fashion design talent Day One of HSBC Colombo
Fashion Week kicked off with the Emerging Designers’ fashion show at the Hilton Colombo
last evening. 8 young designers with potential identified by the President and Founder of
HSBC CFW Ajai Vir Singh spend months being mentored by him and last night they finally
presented their collections to an audience of family, friends and Colombo’s fashionistas.
Bright, talented and clearly with a passion for fashion, these 8 millennial designers
showcased collections which were fresh, interesting and innovative. This augurs well for
fashion in Sri Lanka. Anushika Perera Showcasing at Emerging Designers for the second
time, Anushika the owner of her label Mojo, sent a collection of linen ensembles down the
runway. Inspired by oblique shadows, abstract thoughts and projections of body forms, this
collection was primarily a resort and summer collection. Flared pants with inserts and
trims in contrasting colours along with zip details added interest to Anushika’s
collection which would appeal to young fashionistas. Dinushi Pamunuwa Working primarily
with batik Dinushi launched her new label at Emerging Designers last evening. Her
collection Uniquely Uniform inspired by geometric patters and designs featured long
flowely garments. Checks, chevrons, lines in a muted colour palette were teamed with
bomber jackets. The heaviness of the bomber jacked was negated by the use of a delicate
batik print which gave a lovely feminine edge to it. One to to look out for, Dinushi’s
collection was stylish and commercial. Marlon Rae Presenting a summer collection called
The Art of Survival, this collection represented the fusion of masculinity with a certain
softness. This designer has a great eye for detail which was evident in the presence of
frayed collars and cuffs which added an edginess to his pieces. The use of buckles was the
focal point in his collection. His silhouettes were strong and the colour palette of
mustard, orange, olive green and bright blue denim added a certain boldness to his
collection. Pintucks on a puffed sleeve also added interest to his garments. A perfect
collection for tropical climes, this capsule collection was on point. Mihiri De Silva
Focusing on resortwear, Mihiri’s collection inspired by Japanese Cherry Blossoms featured
artisanal crafts such as batik, embroidery and hand painting. Using a range of cottons and
natural fabric, Mihiri’s collection titled gave an insight to her fashion identity which
is simple silhouettes. Poorni Wijesinghe Khaki and white dominated this collection of a
capsule wardrobe which was created entirely in linen and fabric created from bamboo and
the banana tree. Full marks for innovation, Poorni’s collection featured asymetrical
hemlines on long flowy sihouettes with a few jumpsuits added to the fashion equation. A
designer with ethical manufacturing aspirations, Poorni’s collection stood out due to the
use of her unusual choice of fabrics. Savindri Kuruppu Tulle, cotton and net fabrics
formed the mainstay of this collection which was embroidered with images of faces and
Sinhala typography. Savindri’s design inspiration was drawn from posters, nameboards and
graffiti strewn walls in Sri Lanka. Black and white were her choice of colours with a few
pops of pink breaking up the largely monochrome collection. Dresses, shorts, little
jackets and pants were made interesting with the embroidered faces which resembled the
painting Scream by Norwegian expressionist artist Edvard Munch. The silhouettes were
complemented by her carefully considered detailed embellishments. Vathsala Gunasekara
Frills, flounces and interesting drapes were used to create her collection which
celebrates the space between body and clothing. Launching her ethical brand Chava,
Vathsala used a colour palette of brown, grey and the most subtle hue of lilac. Her
collection consisted of day to evening wear. A designer with a focus on ethical fashion,
Vathsala’s brand encourages fashion for good. Her collection was enlivened with the use of
delicate prints on some of her creations. Yathra Jayawardene Inspired by the glam girls of
yesteryear Hollywood, Yathra presented an absolutely stunning collection of batik prints.Silks, cottons, delicate chiffons and viscose were her choice of fabrics on which her
batik prints were beautifully executed. Soft pastel colours with flowy silhouettes united
perfectly to represent a collection of classically femine clothing which embodies Yathra’s
design ethos. The square collars added drama to an otherwise simple silhouette, and it was
these tiny design details that demonstrated Yathra’s eye for detailing. While her
silhouettes were interesting, her forte undoubtedly lies in textile design as amply
demonstrated by her use of colour and design using the artisanal craft of batik. Closing
show on Day One of HSBC CFW, her collection of twenty outfits were fashion forward and
totally on trend. This is one to watch. TEXT by Tina Edward Gunawardhana and Panchali

life_fashion90_26_The_Handcrafted_Journey_of_Lasanthi_Limited_Edition.pdf,"The Handcrafted Journey of Lasanthi Limited Edition
May 02 2025. By Jessica Mathiasz It all started with 20 handmade clutch purses, a few
greeting cards, and a batch of brownies. Lasanthi never imagined that her small stall at a
Kandy Mums pop-up sale in 2015 would blossom into the luxury purse brand it is today. A
brand that is slowly growing and reaching customers as far as Ireland, Australia, and the
USA. In a world of mass-produced accessories, Lasanthi stands out by creating handmade,
high-quality and beautiful clutch purses. For her, it is never just about business. 'Every
piece is made with love’. I sat down with Lasanthi to learn about her journey, her
inspirations, and what makes her purses so special. Q. How did the idea of ‘Lasanthi
Limited Edition’ come to life? A. I began in the footwear industry, working with Marks and
Spencer right after school. Though I had no formal degree, I got a great opportunity to
learn about technical design and quality craftsmanship, which I never thought would be a
main skill used to build my own business after so many years. In 2015, Kandy Mums, a
platform supporting home-based businesses, invited me to join a sale. I made 20 clutch
purses alongside handmade cards and brownies, not knowing what to expect. But when women
kept picking up those purses, admiring the stitching, asking for custom orders, that's
when something clicked. The brownies didn't stand a chance after that. The response to the
purses was overwhelming and I knew I had found my calling. That’s how Lasanthi Limited
Edition came to life. Q. Where do you find inspiration for your designs? A. Nature and Sri
Lankan tradition inspire me. My mind is always working, thinking of new designs,
materials, and patterns. Whether it's the colours of nature, patterns in ancient art, or
anything unique that catches my eye, I blend these with modern elegance. Every piece I
create is one-of-a-kind. I rarely make more than three or four of the same design, that’s
how I keep them special. If it’s custom-made, then it’s truly yours alone. Q. Walk us
through your creative process. A. I visualize the purse, it comes alive in my mind before
I even sketch. I see the exact curve of the shape, how the fastener will click shut, even
how the handle will feel in someone’s hand. I think those years of pattern-making for
shoes sharpened this instinct. Every clutch is hand-stitched (I only use the machine for
tiny bits), because quality is non-negotiable. When someone buys my work, they’re trusting
me with something precious. That trust, it’s not something you can cut corners with. Q.
What are the materials you use? A. I use whatever that catches my eye. I buy just half a
meter of fabric if it speaks to me and experiment with it. I love working with local
handlooms, batiks and beeralu lace. I also upcycle old saris and use them to make
clutches. Q. What’s the most unique or unexpected material you’ve used in your designs? A.
Once, I used irattu to make a clutch purse. I even designed wooden clutch boxes locally
instead of sourcing them from other countries. Q. Do you make custom purses? A. Oh yes!
That’s my specialty. Ladies send me their saris or outfits to match, and I sketch clutch
options and suggest colours. Some clients even request their names embroidered on the
clutches, which I also do. Q. What makes your purses special? A.I make them with so much
love—the designs, the materials, the craftsmanship. I give 100% every time, pouring my
heart into these purses. That’s what makes them special. Q. Do you have any favourite
pieces? A. It’s impossible to pick. It’s like asking me to choose a favourite child.
Sometimes I finish a purse and just stare at it, thinking, ‘Did I really make this?’.
Every piece is my favourite. Like I’ve said before, I pour my heart into every purse I
create, crafting each one with so much love. I simply can’t choose just one. Q. What was
the most memorable customer reaction? A. I love witnessing every reaction, the moment they
first see the purse, the surprised look on their face, how they admire themselves in the
mirror while holding it. It fills me with joy. One particular customer flew all the way
from Ireland and visited my shop. She told me that buying my purses was one of the reasons
she traveled to Sri Lanka, which absolutely amazed me. She adored them so much that sheeven took a few extra to gift her friends. Q. What is your dream collaboration? A. I
previously collaborated with La Pad by Dinushi Pamunuwa for her Milan Fashion Show. It was
an incredible opportunity. I’ve also worked with Akira Batik and have upcoming projects
with Kamil. Locally, I'd love to collaborate with Dimuthu Sahabandu and Rebel by Ruchira.
I really love their styles. Internationally, I adore Zac Posen’s aesthetic. It would be
great to collaborate with him one day. Q. What is the dream for your brand? A. Some people
in Sri Lanka call me the purse lady. I want to be known for my quality work and become a
brand loved by people in every corner of the world. Follow her journey Instagram: Lasanthi

life_fashion90_27_Ala_Your_One_Stop_Hijab_Store.pdf,"A’la: Your One Stop Hijab Store
Jan 09 2018. Last year in July, Founder Aqeelah Nulair of A’la Hijab Store plunged into
e-commerce with her selection of hijab wraps featuring colors and quality. While A’la
continues to dazzle its client base growing more steeply, we speak to Aqeelah about
embracing religious customs and a classy look. Edited excerpts from an interview: 1) Can
you tell us about the inception of A’la Hijab Store and what inspired you to start it? As
an individual who loved creativity, art and design, my ideas always revolved around pens,
crayons and paper. I stepped into the fashion industry on a sideline at the age of 16 as a
fresher taking part in several fashion shows — despite having next to no solid education
in fashion. I was able to design with the inborn talent that I possessed. No sooner my
higher education was completed in 2017, I decided it was time I put my hands on something
I felt truly passionate about — to start my own venture. Being a Muslim, dressing modestly
is paramount. I loved detailing, accessorizing in keeping with the latest hijab trends
slowly realizing that it wasn’t just me, but the majority who were ‘hijab conscious’ or
‘hijabi’. So it wasn’t a surprise when I chose to venture on fusing fashion trends along
with faith to cater to hijabs that strike a balance between comfort, style, and modesty .
In the late of July 2017, after much planning and support from my loved ones, A’la Hijab
store was born. If not for my loving husband’s unfailing support and encouragement, A’la
would not have seen the light of day. I’m also grateful to my mum for being the driving
force and biggest strength in all my endeavors. 2) Do you only specialize in headwraps? If
not, what other apparels are available for your customers? We offer a wide range of
headwraps — from premium cotton shawls, chiffon and georgette shawls to even cinch cotton
and crinkled shawls. We have also introduced the ‘Pretty Pastel Collection’ inclusive of
pastel coloured headwraps. Our ‘Floral Inspiration’ features floral hijabs which were high
in demand initially. Our customers just loved each and every design! Recently we pinned
the modest wear ankle length cardigans to our clothing line and hope to further introduce
other modest outfits in the near future. 3) Any advice to other young Muslim women wanting
to establish similar stores conforming to Islamic modesty? Hijabis have very little
selection in retail clothing outlets. Mainly because they contradict with the modest
principles. When shopping for myself, either the top appears too short, or it seems too
figure hugging that you end up deciding not to purchase it. We need to bridge the gap and
cater to a variety of modest apparels for those who are keen on Muslim fashion. And my
advice to all young entrepreneurs: think out of the box, escape from the ordinary and try
to introduce something unique, this would help you grow. Be passionate and love what
you’re doing that’s when you can absorb the full satisfaction in what you do. I put my
heart and soul into A’la Hijab store despite the busy schedules, from the flat-lay product
photography, responding to all the constant messages that fill up our inbox, to packaging
and dispatching the orders. Those of you who have an idea to kick-start a new venture, yes
you should! Most of all, your journey will be much lovely as long as you enjoy and know
the purpose or cause of what you are doing. 4) How has social media played a role in
marketing your e-store? Social media has been an amazing platform for businesses to reach
out and show the world what they offer. In relation to A’la Hijab store. Instagram has
done wonders in so little time. Not only have we been able to reach out and tap the right
customers, through our product feed, we have also been able to showcase what exactly we
offer and how they stand out. It has been so convenient to communicate with the customer,
confirm and process orders in no time. Through comments and tag tools, customers get to
interact, voice out their opinions and thoughts on their new grabs. All in all, I believe
all other online stores out there will join me in saying that social media has been
nothing but productive in aiding us to market our products to a wider audience at a given
time. 5) Any popular Muslim fashion icons you admire and why? With the rise of many newfashion bloggers on social networks, there has been a few who have tremendously inspired
me with their sense of Modest Fashion. Running her own Abaya brand ‘Inna Daur’, Innah
Daurova whose page I came across around last year. Her style and sense of modesty are
amazing! I also admire Jasmine Fares (@jasminefares) for her jaw-dropping Instagram posts
on Muslim fashion. Other modest Muslim bloggers include Hanan Tehaili (@hanantebaili)
Samia (sauf.etc) and Hajara Tariq (@hajara_aaa) for their choice of hijab styles and
fashion influence. A’la Hijab Store operates as an online store with deliveries available

life_fashion90_27_Designer_1-2-1_Charuni.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Charuni
Sep 22 2020. Hailing from a family which has worked in the apparel industry since the time
she was a child, Charuni has spent most of her life in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and
Australia. A graduate from Monash University’s School of Commerce, Charuni arrived in Sri
Lanka three years ago and since then has been working in the apparel industry. With no
qualification in fashion, Charuni took up the challenge to learn as much as she can and
has launched a few small brands for local fashion retailers. What inspired the pieces you
created? My inspiration was functionality. Sarees have always been a challenge for me.
Don’t get me wrong, they’re stunning, and I felt special whenever I wore one, and I
appreciated the storied tradition that this garment encapsulated from our culture.
However, sarees were also an inconvenience whenever I had to wear one for special events.
Needed help draping it, had troubles driving in it, don’t even get me started on rationing
bathroom breaks. Think about all the women that have to iron and layout their sarees the
night before they go to work, I didn’t think that it was fair that there wasn’t an
alternative or a loophole that allowed them to wear something comfortable and easy, whilst
conforming to their place of work’s dress code. It also doesn’t hurt that you don’t have
to think twice before jumping onto the dance floor for that song that just calls to you
without having flashbacks to that ONE TIME you face-planted at your second cousin’s second
wedding when your saree pallu got stepped on during the Macarena. Who is your muse?
Shubhika Davda. Founder of “Papa don’t preach by Shubhika”. She’s a boss babe. What is
your design ethos? Moving forward, without forgetting where we come from. It’s about
reclaiming our traditional narratives of style by repositioning it in a context that
allows us to exist in workplaces and social environments without having to sacrifice,
convenience, comfort, time, and aesthetic. What are your sustainability credentials? Our
goals are simple; employ single mothers, with skill-based careers that remunerate them at
a premium, allowing the fostering of economic development to best place their children in
positions that they would have never hoped for themselves. We hope to encourage more women
to engage in the slow fashion movement by allowing for them to mix and match tops and
bottoms and thereby reuse notsarees without feeling like their ensemble has been “seen
before”. How has your feminine identity been portrayed through this collection? It’s in
the name notsaree. We’re unapologetic for rising up, and taking back what’s ours. It’s
time that we stand up to the patriarchy, it’s time we wear the pants. Tina Edward

life_fashion90_27_Designer_1-2-1_Himanthi_Amarasinghe.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Himanthi Amarasinghe
Aug 07 2017. Fashion designer Himanthi Amarasinghe is the owner behind the label
Himilicious. She studied fashion at the Lanka Institute of Fashion Technology (LIFT).
During her three years as a student her mentors helped her learn and develop skills
relating to the industry and gave her ample opportunity to broaden and expand her
creativity. Fashion has always captivated Himanthi and it has been a dream to to be a
fashion designer for as long as she can remember. Starting from making clothes for her
Barbie Dolls, Himanthi is now living her dream of making real clothes for real people.
Since graduating in 2005, Himanthi has focused her energy on building her own brand. What
made you embark on a career in fashion? My main influence was my mother and her sense of
fashion or dressing to be more precise. But other than that it has been my liking from
very small days, in fact the name of my label is something I had in mind since I was in
middle school. Everyone that knows me well knows this is something I’ve been wanting to
do, it’s simply something in me. Being a designer was my ultimate goal, definitely not
something I came up with overnight but all the hard work is worth it. Name of label The
name of my label is H I M I L I C I O U S. It is an exclusive designer wear label catering
to the young women that like to stand out while fitting in. Our range of clothing varies
from casual, to exquisite evening wear. Each piece is carefully hand crafted at my home
studio into tasteful designs. Each piece that is manufactured shows a little reflection of
my personality. We are most famous for our Custom Made garments as we get the chance to
truly bond and build a relationship with our customers. Starting with the initial
discussion to measurement taking, my goal is to give them a total experience rather than a
basic purchase routine. I admit, the greatest joy in my work is the time of reveal, those
jaw dropping moments when the customer sees themselves in front of the mirror. This gives
me joy each time and the encouragement needed to go ahead, I am blessed as I am able to
experience this feeling over and over again. What is your latest collection called My
latest collection is called Urban Chic How would you describe your latest collection?
Urban Chic is one that captures the transition of the youthful woman’s work to night life.
The collection includes youthful and stylish silhouettes which represent the balance
between two elements that are work and night. Urban chic was inspired by pop culture and
everyday instances I notice, it is a bit hard to explain exactly what they are as it’s a
very broad spectrum. What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri
Lanka? Truth be told, I am not looking to become a commercial brand where anyone can
purchase anywhere, as I mentioned my specialty is the whole experience and in my opinion
with mass production it kills the engagement or personal connection I am able to build
with the customer. The most challenging aspect is the start. Building up the brand to suit
the market and creating a unique element to stand out from the competition. With many
designer labels opening up, the brand has to have a very strong point that makes it
different from the rest. Where do you retail your stuff? H I M I L I C I O U S is
currently retailed at RAMP at Liberty Plaza and almost 75% online through Facebook and
Instagram. Although these are the two main outlets we also started participating in pop-
up-stalls selected at random. And we always notify our fans well in advance. My top
fashion tip is “always dress to impress because that is how you leave your mark,
everywhere you go.” What is your latest project? One of our most recent projects has been
the launch of our collaborated sub brand BLUSH AND GUSH. It is a bridal attire brand in
partnership with KAY DEAN one of the household names in bridal accessories. Together in
collaboration we have planned and put together a tasteful experience where we provide our
beautiful Sri Lankan brides with elegant, extravagant dresses for the day of their dreams.
What’s next for Himiliscious? We are looking at delivering confidence but with subtle
feminine elements which is the identity of the brand. For example, more dramatic andvoluminous silhouettes that is bold and powerful but at the same time, in order to suit
our clientele we will look at soft hues and intricate details to bring out the feminine
identity. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_27_Designer_1-2-1_Tif_Florentina.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Tif Florentina
Jun 08 2021. Founder of Nakota Tuwa, Tif Florentina’s interest in fashion was sparked by
the mother and her grandmother who were both designers. Launched last year, Tif who
studied fashion design at Sheffield Hallam University in the UK wants those who wear her
creations to feel beautiful, confident, elegant, comfortable, to feel themselves. What
made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? I really enjoyed
designing and sewing since I was a little girl. I used to draw millions of sketches of
girls in different outfits. How has your work evolved since you began your own label? It’s
come on leaps and bounds. We have now truly established an identity and people know when
it's a Nakota Tuwa piece due to the earthy tones and also there is always a little silver
feather charm on it. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? I wouldn't
say I avoid designing anything really. It’s depending on what I’m inspired by at that
moment. But I’ve got to say I’m not really into prints or anything floral and pink. Where
do you look for creative inspiration? I follow many different designers big and small and
also am a massive fan of Pinterest. It’s a great place to find inspiration to help with
parts of my designs. Also, I love looking at the 70’s boho-chic styles. Describe your
latest collection? The latest collection that was released at The Design Collective was
our ‘Be your own kind of beautiful’ campaign which was all about loving yourself whatever
shape or size. All of our clothing is free size and we did a wonderful shoot with Vera
Nording Photography and some incredible models. Some were over 60, we have more
curvaceous, pregnant and also different skin tones. This was to show that the clothing
really does suit everyone. Who is your muse? To be honest my muse has always been my Mum.
She's the coolest and most stylish woman I know. She’s always worn things to suit her body
shape and be elegant but always comfortable. What are your sustainability credentials? We
are a small company and make small numbers this avoids any mass production and the waste
associated with it. We also get all our fabrics from shops that have got offcuts from
larger factories. We have a wonderful small group of women that hand make everything and
put a lot of love into the clothing. We also donate 10% of profits to a local charity.
What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? At the
moment I’m going through a real health hype by changing my diet to a more plant-based diet
and also really working on fitness but in a beautiful flowing feminine way and trying new
types of exercise that I’ve never done. This shows in the activewear and we also did a
wellness month last month where we blogged different exercises for a month for people to
do at home easily. As a lot of our customers are also in Europe we wanted to help and give
them motivation every day whilst in lockdown. What is the biggest lesson that you have
learned since you started your company? Don’t worry! Worry is so unnecessary and doesn’t
help anything at all. Just keep calm, take deep breaths and everything flows in the way it
needs to and you find the path that you’re supposed to be on, instead of trying to force a
route that's not for you. What role do you think social media plays in fashion today? A
massive part, especially since Covid-19. This is where I find most of my customers and
also a great way to keep connected and keep the communication with everyone. What is your
favourite part about being a designer? I love it all. I've got to say the part I do love
the most is actually the sketching of initial designs and then translating that to pattern
pieces. Even though I don’t have the most mathematical brain, pattern cutting just makes
sense and is so much fun to create a pattern from scratch. How do you want women to feel
when wearing your clothes? Going back to our most recent campaign, I want everyone to feel
beautiful, confident, elegant, comfortable, but mainly I want them to feel themselves and
truly love themselves. I want them, whether it’s walking down the street or at a lovely
party, to feel amazing and believe that they are beautiful. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

life_fashion90_27_Hair_and_Makeup_Looks_for_MBFW_Sri_Lanka.pdf,"Hair and Makeup Looks for MBFW Sri Lanka
Oct 22 2018. Sri Lanka’s is just days away from an exciting weekend of fashion with the
advent of Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka. 64 designers are billed to showcase their
collections over three days of back to back fashion shows. Getting the right look to
complement the collections is of paramount important and in charge of this is one of
Colombo’s leading hair and beauty salons, Kess. This year, Vasantha de Silva the genial
owner of Kess will join forces with representative of Kevin Murphy and President of the
Asia Pacific Region, Andrew Tetley to create some fashion forward looks for the runway. In
an exclusive interview with Life, Vasantha gives us a sneak peek of what to expect at the
shows. How did your collaboration with Kevin Murphy come about? Vasantha: I have never
stopped researching on new hair products. After having seen Kevin Murphy, the product was
tested and I fell in love with it. I started using it myself and then in my salon and KESS
became the flagship store using only Kevin Murphy. Within a matter of few weeks, Kevin
Murphy sent his representative Andrew Tetley, President of the Asia Pacific Region to meet
me and the rest is history. I was appointed as the Brand Ambassador for Kevin Murphy in
Sri Lanka and the Maldives. I get a lot of support from the session stylists for their
editorial work as they have a huge hair team. We have invited Andrew twice to Sri Lanka to
see the show, and in 2017, he gave a presentation on the product formulation of KM. He
liked the strength of the show and was keen in collaborating with MBFW Sri Lanka. As he
had come to the show twice, he was impressed with the standards and designs and was keen
coming on board in 2018! They are involved in a similar one in Melbourne called the
‘Fashion Week’ and have been collaborating with them for the past 7 years. What sort of
looks will you be putting together for the show? Vasantha: Most of the looks are going to
be natural, a glowing skin with a sun kissed effect. We are inspired by the 80’s look and
will integrate this into the present ‘now look’ for 2019. I believe that the hair has to
be like a mermaid’s. It should be baby hair, wet looking, comfortable and stress free.
Nothing too structural – totally relaxed with just a knot perhaps – not too tailored. The
structure has to look like a woman who is busy – someone who would do the hair styling by
herself and not too messy. What looks will you be creating for MBFWSL? Andrew: We will be
creating a variety of looks specifically designed for each designer. It will be a unique
look to suit each distinctive runway show. I can’t tell you more as I might spoil the
runaway moment for the designers - it will all come together at the show. What are the
latest hair and makeup trends? We’ve seen a lot of the big fashion houses mixing and
matching a lot of different fabrics and textures that in theory shouldn’t go together but
it works. Hair and makeup is heading in the same direction; mixing old and new to create
contemporary styles. Natural hair texture and curl is still in and finding products to
enhance it. Hair trends no longer come and go it’s about your world of diversity and
acceptance - it’s all about the individual. What are you inspired by this season? When it
comes editorial hair and runway, my inspiration always comes from simplicity. A lot of the
time I might get inspiration on a train or just people watching and thinking how can I
make that look editorial and how I can make something complicated not only look simple but
make the hair easy and quick to do What other work will you be doing in Sri Lanka? Kevin
Murphy will be having a pop-up at the Urban Island Concept Store in Colombo 07 from the
26th to 28th October, and as a part of this pop, I will be doing a hair-styling workshop
and share beauty tips etc. at the store on Saturday, the 27th October from 10 am – 12noon.
I look forward to seeing you all there. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

good, comfort in clothing and lots of compliments. Q2. How is your experience in the
fashion industry? It’s good. It’s different. Before, I used to be a model so I learnt a
lot. Now I am training models, I am grooming them with my past experiences. I make sure
they don’t face the struggles that I have been through. When you get into the industry,
you usually don’t know who to contact as there are many agencies that work for the
economy. To be honest, at first I didn’t know what a ramp was. There are many ramps. T
ramp, U ramp, D ramp. And not to mention the lighting, sounds, walking styles. I slowly
learned and got into many agencies. Q3. What made you quit modelling and move into fashion
designing? Modelling was my hobby but designing is my passion. And I have always wanted to
be in the fashion field. It was just like a shift from one bedroom to another bedroom. It
was like shifting from the smaller bedroom into the bigger one. Along with modelling, I
used to be a fitness trainer. I was learning American council on exercise. So I was like
“Okay, let me have a shift”. For a better income, training and due to the fact that I was
always into fashion. I started learning designing and gaining experience. And later did my
own fashion shows. Q4. What is your favourite part of being a designer? My favourite part
of being a designer is client satisfaction and happiness of wearing my designs. When my
clients praise my work, I feel that it’s all worth the effort even if I don’t get paid
much. Q5. Can you tell us a bit about your collections? I am more of an Indian ethnic
type. I do more of hand designing called hand embroidery which is more in demand in India.
I had to travel and research organic fabrics and varieties of colours. In India, there is
more demand for cotton. When it comes to shows, it usually depends on the theme. Or I have
to make my own theme. I prefer to always go with ethnic. That’s a decent and Indian look.
If it is a long run show, more than 15 minutes, I go with Western style costumes. Q6. What
are your common colour choices? As I know, most females like black. I use the dark
colours. Men like blue, royal blue...the different shades, beige and cream. Q7. Where do
you get your inspirations from? My dad was a film distributor and I saw the costumes he
used to provide for the actors. I also saw pictures that inspired me as well. Designing is
all about imagination. To imagine, put into papers, and create. I create some designs
within 15 minutes and some take days. I need a relaxed mind and peace when I design. I am
never “done” with my designs. It just goes on. Q8. How do you keep up with the trends?
There are two ways. You either create a trend or follow a trend. When creating a trend,
you need a celebrity so that people tend to follow. Or else, you have to follow a trend by
designing something closest to the latest styles. We cannot make a replica since it will
be fake. We have to use trends as a reference. Q9. Do you have any types of clothing that
you dislike and tend to avoid? I avoid wearing clothes that are not very comfortable on
me. Tight fitting clothes and light colours are the ones that I do not like. Q10. Do you
have different approaches for menswear and womenswear? There are many options when
designing for women. We can mix the Indo and Western accessories as well. Compared to
women, men have less options in accessorising. And as I know, most men prefer to wear
watches, etc. on a daily basis. Q11. Would you like to say anything to the youngdesigners? If they are planning to do their own boutique, own brand, or online business,
then a good finance and base client is important. I started with zero clients and now I
have hundreds. In a business prospective, there’s a lot of price differences. It’s always
better to check and make use of even the minor price difference. Save some money always.
It will always help you to fulfil your dreams and desires. And after completing
graduation, if a goal is not yet set, go for Master’s. Don’t waste time sitting at home.
You can never be lazy. If you want to be lazy, it is best to find another job. Always
create new, different things, think out of the box and be a creator whom people follow.
These days the trend is always behind the brands. People are ‘brand-freaked’. I believe
you should go with the quality than the brand. Brand is just publicity so that people feel
‘Wow’. Q12. What do you think of Sri Lankan Cultural Clothing? It is very nice. I feel
ethnicity in it. Very decent and colourful. I would maybe make something in India so that
I can take Sri Lankan culture to our country. Your comment (*)",5482

life_fashion90_27_Pramoda_Indeewara_-Self_Belief_to_the_path_of_Success.pdf,"Pramoda Indeewara -“Self Belief to the path of Success”
Mar 13 2018. Introduction Pramodya Indeewara adapting Kandy as his hometown and heritage
studied at Dharmaraja College Kandy. Whereas, his parents were into the relevant
professions of Mother a High School teacher and Father a business-man. Being the younger
of the two elder siblings he is very sentimental towards the family. Pramodya is always
grateful to his family and friends Dumindu, Nimna, Chavini and Sachin) who played a great
role in his college life by reliving his stress, along with the immense support from Karen
Macleod (Principal of AOD), throughout the entire course. Background Questioning about his
Final Year Collection Pramodya had the immense interest towards video games and thriller,
action movies which paved him the pathway to produce the collection of “Men’s Outer Wear”
inspired by “Assasins Creed” and “Renaissance Armour” to create a concept design of giving
the wearer a feeling of thrill and fictional adventure in reality, in turn gave him a
positive response in the runway show. The love towards Pramodya’s school life, being a
very good art student led him to win the “Premadasa Velianga Memorial Award” for mastering
art at a very young age. College life for Pramodya was different basically being like a
“Rollercoaster ride”. He had been through tough situations led him to take a year break
from college, for music always being his reason of escape motivated him to start his own
band accompanied by some of his friends in the name “ AMUTHU ”. Thus, with all this , he
got back with college by managing the studies along with running the band helped him to
experience and teach him how to manage time efficiently. Pramodya’s learning experience at
college was an extraordinary platform that helped him gain a massive amount of knowledge
in the fields of “Fashion, Industry, Art, Design, and Techniques for the movement of the
next step of life. Fashion Experiences 01) How did you develop your interest in fashion
design? Being an artist, influenced me the most to develop an interest in the field of
fashion designing. The all-time interest of wearing something unique and never liked
seeing someone wearing an outfit similar to mine, made me design my own clothes deriving
the interest into fashion. 02) What are the important facets of the fashion industry? The
best thing about the fashion industry is that I get to design my own ideas in the way I
wanted it to be by still influencing the people, who really understands the concept behind
fashion and my relevant theme. 03) What according to you is the favorite part of being a
fashion designer? I don’t really like being sheltered under one specific style; the
flexibility within me to design style is the favorite part of me being a fashion designer.
04) How would you describe your personal style? When talking about my personal style I
always wish to work in streams of designing “Jeans” and going on hand in hand with “Hard
Materials such as Leather, Denim, etc”. 05) In what general area of design do you work or
wish to work? I mostly do my trend research in my spare time and I believe the “Kick Off”
trends right now are “Military Fashion” and “Denim”, thus, at the moment I would like to
work in that particular area. 06) How do you stay up to date with fashion, what trends do
you currently see in the fashion industry? Well, to do fashion, age does not matter “We
have to do what people would prefer”, mostly the “20s”. “It’s not just about designing
something that people would randomly buy, but what people would actually prefer to buy”.
07) What motivates you as a fashion designer to know your target audience? What motivates
me as a fashion designer to know my target audience is, “Just to be crazy” because ""All
the best people are crazy"" and as my Principal, Karen says ""If you are doing fashion, you
have to get married to fashion”. 08) Designer Tip “Do not hesitate to be someone different
and bring a change, if you think you’re unique, you sure as well show them you are
unique”. Text: Harthika Ganeshan Your comment (*)",4093

life_fashion90_28_ART_CONNECT_by_CFW.pdf,"ART CONNECT by CFW
Mar 14 2017. Kicking off a week of Colombo Fashion Week under the theme ‘Celebrating
Colombo’, the ART CONNECT was the first of a series of events lined up this week. Under
the theme, ‘Second Skin’, the event bought together five major artists under one roof for
the first time ever to showcase artistic work inspired by fashion. Speaking to the CEO of
Colombo Fashion Week, Fazeena Rajabdeen, she tells us that this event is one of the many
celebrating CFW’s theme this year. “We are creating a great experience and taking
Celebrating Colombo to heart. Fashion is like second skin and so is Art so today we are
celebrating this together”. The exhibition was curated by Chamika De Alwis, who tells us
that in looking at the idea of fashion and art he selected 5 artists he felt where best in
line with the theme. “These artists where the first people I thought connected their art
with fashion unconsciously.” Founder and President of Colombo Fashion Week, Ajai Vir Singh
was equally enthusiastic about this event, “What we are achieving today is two creative
streams blending into one and it’s great to see two streams that are different but also
similar come together to showcase.” Kingsley Gunathilaka Born in Wadduwa, Kingsley has had
his work exhibited across the world and has attended numerous workshops in Sri Lanka and
abroad.His journey in life reflected through abstract art on canvas with the mixing of
colour insisting on an ""uncomplicated space free of problems. Tell us a bit about your
collection. This collection started out from a fashion design magazine project where I
blended a variety of colours and hidden certain objects and figures in the painting to
depict fashion. What’s the inspiration behind it? I have been to many fashion shows and
just seeing the colours and movements and the silhouettes on the runways I was inspired to
incorporate them all into my painting. One of my most favourite artists Cy Twombly gave me
the inspiration of including scribble like illustrations in my painting. When did you get
into the artistic field? I’m a teacher at the College of Fine Arts and I teach visual art
and work with illustrations and graphic designs. I started art about 30-40 years ago and
have been painting ever since. What do you want your audience to feel when they see your
artwork? I think it’s up to the audience to feel what they feel. I want them to take in
the colours and admire the shapes and movements hidden in the canvas. What are your
thoughts on combining fashion and art at CFW’s ART CONNECT? I think it’s a great
opportunity and for me without fashion there is nothing and it’s two streams that just
goes together always so I’m glad for this chance. Mahen Perera Mahen Perera trained in
Multi-Disciplinary Design at the National Design Centre in Colombo before going on to
pursue his BA in Fine Arts from the Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore in
affiliation with the Open University U.K., where he was awarded a first class Honors and
was the recipient of the prestigious Winston Oh travel award in 2007 which allowed him to
undertake a month-long residency in Prague. His works have been exhibited in Sri Lanka,
Singapore and Vietnam. His work explores the innate mutability of materials that gravitate
between painting and sculpture; how permutation reconstructs and provides new stimuli for
visual perception. Tell us a bit about your collection. Well, it starts with early work
wash canvasses where I paint on the canvass first and then I wash them so it leaves this
spontaneous print on the canvas. And then the scene moves from paintings to objects where
I’ve sewed and blended the canvas to create objects. What’s the inspiration behind it? I
think material is the ‘second skin’ of what I am doing and this second skin tells a lot
about fashion in it’s own manner. When did you get into the artistic field? My brother is
an antique dealer and when I went around with him looking for antiques that curiosity to
find something interesting and new just drew me into art and I loved it and this passion
just developed from art school. What do you want your audience to feel when they see your
artwork? Artists just ‘see’ what is on the canvas. I want them to feel whatever they want
to feel and if they don’t feel anything I can’t force it. For me art is very personal andsubjective. What are your thoughts on combining fashion and art at CFW’s ART CONNECT? I
think this is an interesting concept. This is social commentary and looking at all the
elements of fashion and making it into art is something that naturally happens because art
and fashion are all just in under one spectrum. Pala Pothupitiye Pothupitye received his
art education at the Visual and Performance Art University at Colombo, graduating with a
BFA in sculpture.He confronts issues such as colonialism, nationalism, religious extremism
and extends his inquiry to questions of caste, the distinction between arts and crafts,
tradition and modernity. Sanjaya Geekiyanage Sanjaya Geekiyanage graduated from the
University of Visual and Performing Arts majoring in Sculpture. He uses copper as a medium
for his work; evoking different colours from the material. His is an unusual technique of
wrecking the copper and reassembling it for sculptures. Tell us a bit about your
collection. This is based on fashion mannequins and I’ve done it in the form of a
sculpture. What’s the inspiration behind it? I’ve got my inspiration by looking at the
form of the mannequin and I was influence by the structure of ‘Gokkola leafs’. When did
you get into the artistic field? I’ve been involved in sculptures for a long time but this
kind of style dealing with direct material I only started 3 years ago. What do you want
your audience to feel when they see your artwork? I want them to see the human form and
feel the rhythm within. What are your thoughts on combining fashion and art at CFW’s ART
CONNECT? I always believe that if there is no fashion there is no art and if there is no
art there is no fashion! Sanjeewa Kumara With a Bachelor of Fine Arts of the Institute of
Aesthetic Studies from the University of Kelaniya, Sanjeewa has presented his works abroad
as well as in Sri Lanka. In his artwork, he explores the use of lush, sensual imagery, and
how the collision of Western pop culture and the South Asian island's post colonial legacy
impacts his imagination. Tell us a bit about your collection. I have used old paintings
and cut and pasted them on new canvases like one would do with photo shop and painted over
it with acrylic paint to create woman like figures and even futuristic figures. What’s the
inspiration behind it? Well, combining it with fashion and art, as my canvas I’ve used a
very saree like material and I drew inspiration from my Kandyan heritage to reinvent the
typical Kandyan paintings from the lining to the colours. When did you get into the
artistic field? I got involved with art by accident. Since Ordinary Levels I have been
doing traditional paintings and since then I have worked on my art for over 15 years. What
do you want your audience to feel when they see your artwork? I want the audience to feel
the difficulty and the effort it takes to create such a print and also for them to feel
how the art connects to fashion. What are your thoughts on combining fashion and art at
CFW’s ART CONNECT? I’ve been a painter for 15 years and I’ve always thought fashion and
art has a strong tie together. So I think this is a great exhibition. Law Graduate, food

fashion council and British fashion council. I felt it is a great start that the
Commonwealth is looking at collaborating to create common opportunities for designers.
With fashion evolving, it is interesting to see new market opportunities present itself to
promote our fashion industry in Sri Lanka. With this experience, what have you brought
back to the island and its bountiful designers? It was very fruitful for me as the various
meetings and engagements gave me an insight of the direction of where fashion is moving.
London is one of the fashion capitals of the world and it can give you a sense. and then
it helps you plan your direction. Two Sri Lankan designers were exposed in two different
categories and that was very encouraging. I am hoping that through my role i will be able
to expose more Sri Lankan designers and their unique creations. It also helps to
understand what position designers from SriLanka need to ascertain to make themselves
visible on global platforms. Overall that was a great learning and outing. It will be
uselful for all. We heard about the exciting private discourse with TRHS Duchess of
Cambridge and Sophie the Countess of Wessex. Would you give us an insight to this meeting?
This was very interesting. 8 council members along with Dame Anna Wintour and Livia Firth
were the core people invited to a private meeting before the Commonwealth fashion exchange
exhibition. They were briefed of our roles. TRH Kate Middleton spent time along with
Sophie understanding what we do and what we plan to do in the role we have. i was quite
happy as i got the chance to share the responsible fashion movement with Kate Middleton as
she had earlier announced that she would be suporting or lending her weight behind the
eco-sustainable fashion. It was great sharing that. She is charming, intelligent and a
good listener. What was your most memorable moment during this event? Well there were a
few, being at Buckingham Palace and having a chance to meet and see people like Stella
McCartney, Naomi Campbell,Suzi Menkes, Anna Wintour, Livia Firth, key representative of
the council. It was quite memorbale as it broadens your scope and gets you to focus. i was
so happy to meet my old friend Bibi Russell, who we all know, is such a global powehouse
in fashion. She was the center of attention in UK too, covered in all the media. We are
previliged that she visits us in Sri Lanka and spends time with our designers, with whom
he was delighted to spend time with. I am planning more things with her here too. How do
you plan on broadening the responsible fashion movement? The responsble fashion movement
is aleady on its way and there are activities planned this month.We have done
international tie-ups, so it can be given interntional exposure to showcase Sri Lanka
through that lens. it’s a strategic step you will hear more of. people in London were very
excited about the scope of it. It is very meaningful. Any noteworthy and inspiring
creations that you saw at the exhibition? I liked Bibi Russells creation using Jamdhani
technique, it was just stupendous. Stella McCartney’s creation with an Indian weaver was
fun, then creation from Kenya and Karen Walkers from New Zealand was strong. Darshi was
good and i also liked the one from Malaysia. What does this role of the ‘commonwealth
fashion council member’ push you to do for the fashion community of SriLanka? My plan is
to position sri lankan designers in a unique manner where craft, design sensibility and
eco-ethcial methods are positioned strongly, so that more get exposed at this level. it’s
a great opening. In addition to the commonwealth fashion exchange there was another
program at council level that was 100% made in the commonwealth where we exposed talented
young designer Vatshala Gunesekara who deisgned a backpack bag using cork material and
natural dyes, which was produced in another country. this was also presented in anotherexhibiton the follwong day at london. we are now evaluating commercial production and
retail for this bag in these markets. At this present moment, how far have our lankan
fashion designers come in keeping to the ‘ethical and sustainable fashion design’
movement? This movement is very close to my heart, after coining the phrase ‘garments
without guilt’ over a decade ago and leading a team for promoting it, i am glad that once
again another unique movement which is end-to-end is taking shape and whats of greater
interest is that we already have an envrionment for that but are not aware or educated
about it. if the environment is present then the young designers are already at an
advantage to be the early-movers and be an example to the region. whats encouraging is
that a numer of our young sri lankan designers that i meet already come with ec0-ethcial
direction in their hearts. they are conscious of it so their actions are dictated by it.
that itself is a good start. yes there are chanllenges to it but we are creating solutons
working with subject matter experts so more Sri Lankan designers are part of it. Your

life_fashion90_28_CFW_Luxury_Edition.pdf,"CFW Luxury Edition
Nov 14 2022. Responding positively to the challenge of how designers define luxury in Sri
Lanka using the crafts that are available and upgrading the design and skills quotients,
the designers have created stunning collections which are set to enthral Colombo’s fashion
aficionados at the CFW Luxury Edit to be held on 17th November at Galle Face Hotel. The
CFW fashion runway is a red letter day in the Sri Lankan fashion calendar as it provides a
much-needed platform for Sri Lankan designers to showcase their latest collections
highlighting artisanal crafts of Sri Lanka. The Luxury Edition will feature designers
Darshi Keertisena of Buddhi Batiks, Charini Suriyage, Sonali Dharmawardena, Fouzul Hameed,
Aslam Hussein, Lovi Ceylon, Dinushi Pamanuwa, Harinda Gunawardene, Kamil Hewavitharana,
Ayesh Wickramarathne and Kingsman. Kamil Hewavitharana The eclipse, people just see it as
that, but if you look at it closer, you can see the beautiful colours caused by it. My
collection will be 15 or 18, due to time constraints, 2 of which would be bridals. I am
using black as my base colour, themed with red, green, and orange. Luxurious, showing a
strong, empowered look, making a woman feel, confident of herself in every way. As I said
before, the beauty of the eclipse and what it means, it takes 3 bodies to create this
beautiful phenomenon. the biggest challenge is time, but I took it and will create an
amazing collection. Also for this collection, I am using different fabrics which I have
never used before. Colombo Fashion Week reaches an International market and we have to
show them what we are capable of doing, as a Sri Lankan how much we can contribute to
international markets. I want to give my best, as always. Luxury to me means high-end,
looking expensive and classy... What I believe is if you really want to do something
exclusive, there is no price for it. I have used some leftover fabric, from my previous
collections, together with the new, to create totally different silhouettes. Harinda
Gunawardena Penumbra I have put together 12 looks of luxury occasional wear for my
segment. I have tried to bring out colours which stand out. My colour palette for this
collection has been inspired by jewel tones with saturated colours, through which the
designs have turned out to be dynamic and eye-catching. The silhouettes are voluminous and
flowing, making the collection more dynamic and fluid. Most of the silhouettes are free-
sized and designed to be unstructured and flexible. The luxury silk fabrications further
enhance the silhouettes. Inspired by the space between illumination and perfect shadows,
Penumbra focuses on bringing out the depth of the shadows through contemporary local batik
craft working on voluminous and fluid silhouettes to craft luxury design by incorporating
contemporary local batik craft. Operating under volatile conditions is quite challenging
and it has been quite the battle putting this collection together as there are many
factors to consider. However, it has been a great learning curve for me and I really
enjoyed overcoming the challenges and putting together this collection. I believe as
designers we need to communicate resilience and positivity and this is a perfect example
of how everything falls together. Luxury for me is comfort, simplicity and elegance. I
have portrayed these attributes through my designs putting together a collection of
crafted luxury. However, as a creative person, I personally believe that we need to be
creative in terms of our thinking. We need to embrace the situation with positivity and
adopt a creative approach not only when it comes to our designs but also to practical
scenarios on how we overcome challenges. So by thinking and operating this way, I was able
to overcome the challenges and put together a collection inspired by creativity in all
forms. HARID by HARINDA GUNAWARDENA is a brand that believes in and fosters self-love and
confidence whilst promoting the value of being comfortable with oneself, is inspired by
everything that revolves around us concentrating on one’s emotions and feelings. The
designs which come to life through HARID communicate these values in their intricate forms
whilst giving top priority to promoting local heritage craft practices by working hand inhand with home-based artisans to uplift whilst incorporating it into the brand. This
collection utilizes fully natural and biodegradable materials to a great extent. This
collection has helped give back to society as I have concentrated on a locally sourced and
produced model, ensuring ethical sourcing. production and business practices. Sonali
Dharmawardene Q1: Tropical sundown. Q2: 15 silhouettes. Q3: Jewel colours of a sundown
sky. Q6: It has been highly challenging, due to the non-availability of many requirements.
Hence using fabric from a prior project and working them together. Q7: In the context of
fashion: luxury means fabulous, comfortable yet elegant fabrics. Unique. Singled-out
pieces. Boutique or atelier styled …. Q8: I think the only way to handle the economic
climate is to get creative. Hence using either different mediums, forms, and working
colour stories together. Re-use re-invent. Q9: It’s a challenge to meet all 3 aspects all
the time. However, it’s a must to make every effort. Aslam Hussain Opening the LUXURY
edition at the Colombo Fashion Week with a theatrical flair is Aslam Hussein who will be
presenting two statuesque statement pieces of sheer grace. She is spirited and confident
treasuring our handcrafted heritage in a contemporary outlook. Conformed to her legacy,
carried by our artistry, concurred by the now, she’s an Aslam Hussein bride drawn to the
old world, romanticized in modern influences. Fouzul Hameed FH collection for Hameedia.
Mainly dark colours for evening functions and to give a luxurious look. It’s more of power
dressing. Very elegant, rich and luxurious. Italian Ceremonial wear. It has been a really
tough last few years and specially in Sri Lanka when most imports are banned and as a
Desinger getting the best fabrics, accessories and raw material down has been difficult.
For me, luxury means creating power, craftsmanship in each detail using the best of
everything to manufacture a top class product. It’s challenging but our experience and
ability to create a great product that our customers appreciate has made them remain loyal
even in difficult times. You can’t simply compromise any single detail. We always use
natural fabrics from wool, silk wool, and linen silk and using sustainable and ethical way
has been a key pillar of our brand value. Dinushi Pamunuwa Touched by an Angel. Black,
beige and white with some reds and navy blues Feminine, figure-hugging and flowy The night
light in the city infused with a starry night sky We did the collection in a short period
of time so that was the biggest challenge. To make sure we found the balance not to
overpower the Batik was exciting and brought out a fresh new side of La Pard. Elegant and
timeless but infused with simplicity. We sought to find a balance between the ever-rising
cost of products, and the rising cost of living and bringing out a timeless piece that a
customer can cherish for years to come. The Batik artisans and their time-consuming work
are what our brand revolves around but, this time we have also used some leftover fabrics
from our “fabric box” that we accumulated over the years. Ayesh Wickramaratne I will be
showcasing 15 outfits which will be in black, dull gold, powder blue and safari colours. I
have drawn my inspiration from the human /elephant conflict. My inspiration is a very
sensitive topic and I have depicted that story in my collection. My definition of luxury
is confidence. No one’s definition of luxury is the same. My collection contains zero
waste fabrics and I have used hand embroidery, and embellishments. Dharshi Keerthisena
Capsule collection of 15 looks There are a few colour stories such as black and greys,
red, orange sari and hot pink, olive, aqua and purple. Mostly tailored outfits. Trusting
the light and venturing into the darkness. Fearless and learning not to apologise for our
wild. Inspiration came from a couple of things. Post-pandemic survival inward self-
journey, love for the local, a poem by Nikita Gill. Time has been a big challenge and also
securing raw materials such as fabric, dyes and chemicals, unregulated raw material prices
and of course the weather when doing batik. Unique, high quality and comfortable. This has
been a challenge but our team has been working consciously with this in mind; We are
blessed with a resilient and loyal team, and this has been our key to survival. Working
with local artisans has been our biggest strength. Using biodegradable dyes and chemicalsto create batik, always trying to create a circular economy within Buddhi Batiks.
Sustainability and the practises having been a journey we are on and not a destination.
LOVI Ceylon I feel like there is a tenderness in our interactions today. The ongoing
challenges we face are softening us. Gone is the brut and bravado. Instead, we are
yearning. Eager. Ready to build our new and prosperous Sri Lanka. From this quiet place,
we are preparing to shine, That’s why we chose to call the collection Shine. We have
nearly 25 brand-new looks in this collection. Nearly 70 pieces of clothing. This is a
collection of joyful celebration—Gold, crimson, pastels, and of course white and black.
We’re inventing a modern Sri Lankan clothing identity by celebrating Hindu, Muslim,
Christian and Buddhist cultural influences in our outfits in this collection. Our
people—the maturity, resilience and hope of our people. It took more than 50 hours of hand
embroidery on one of the green jackets in the collection. We custom-dyed it to get a
particular shade of green. And our senior suitmaker took 3 days to complete the new fit of
the jacket—and it looks divine. In fact, we have used one or more Sri Lankan crafts in
every one of the 70 pieces in the collection. This has been the most labour-intensive
collection we have crafted. It’s a lightness, like the glow in your heart you feel when
you see your kid smile. The joyous smell of a jasmine flower. These are luxury to me. We
try to create this lightness for you when you wear LOVI. Buy local. I urge everyone
reading this to buy from your local shops and local designers as much as possible. Not
only because you get exclusive, designer pieces for much less than imports, but also
because the majority of the money stays in your own neighbourhood and in the country.
Collectively we spend billions of rupees on imported clothes, even today. So let’s buy
local. While there are some beads and sequins that will need to be recycled or up-cycled,
this collection is primarily made of biodegradable fabrics like cotton, silk, linen,
handlooms and even beads. Luxury Black Tie Reimagined Collection Two looks-Groom's suit
and Bridal suit Clean and well-structured silhouettes Inspired by a different vision of
Black tie to redefine stereotypes and present not just another ordinary Groom & Bride.
Lilac was chosen as it represents spirituality and tranquillity. The goal was to add an
exclusive colour to the Groom & Bride's outfit that will set them apart from traditional
couples. It has been increasingly challenging, as given the current economic conditions
and import restrictions there is a shortage of raw materials so we had to fly down the
fabrics and RM required for our collection for the show. Luxury to me means a sense of
accomplishment and increases self-esteem. The focus on handcraft, impeccable quality and
attention to detail create a high-value luxury design product in my opinion. We serve a
very niche clientele who are after luxury and we do not want to compromise the quality of
our custom-made products at any point, even though there is significant inflation in the
imported raw materials we use. However wherever possible we try to come up with
alternative cost-effective ways in both stitching and for raw materials while keeping the
design and client requirements at the core. The fabrics we have used for both ensembles
are 100% natural eco-friendly Italian wool that can be ethically traced. Having slow
fashion at the core like all our custom-made suits, each garment is made by an individual
highly skilled tailor who spends considerable time and effort to craft the high-quality
suit. Furthermore, a good custom-made suit is an investment which can be worn multiple
times for multiple occasions over the garment's life. It is this notion that we actively
promote and has been our brand mantra. Furthermore, a groom always reuses his suit after
the wedding and we encourage the client to have his future purpose in mind when deciding
on his wedding suit to get multiple uses out of it and at the same time we ensure he
stands out on his big day. Charini Suriyage All that glitters Using shimmer metallics this
season. From pastel shimmery fabrics to deeper metallic silvers and khakis and golds They
are sexy, constructed silhouettes... I want to add more fitted silhouettes this time to
the collection. We have added corset tops which are super styling items for anyone’swardrobe for the season.. and drapes that are figure-hugging rather than loose and flowy
We deserve a bit of extra excitement this season. Especially after a few years of gloom
and doom, it's nice to have a bit of luxury and sophistication in our lives. Wanted to go
for a very uncomplicated fun inspiration, keeping circularity in mind. We want every piece
to be still practical and versatile. Other than the day-to-day challenges the biggest
challenge has been sourcing fabric. the prices of fabrics have shot up significantly and
with import restrictions, we have to be extra creative on how to work with what's
available in Sri Lanka. The attention to detail and good craftsmanship is luxury to me.
The effort that goes into creating pieces that are not mass-produced is luxury. Being eco-
conscious while doing the above is a luxury for me. We have to be super creative and
innovative. when there are limits on raw material imports on a plus side we would
eventually have more locally manufactured materials, but until then, the immediate
challenges have to be sorted. needless to say, the cost of manufacturing has gone up, but
at CHARINI we still try to keep things affordable by having a variety of price points.
From a design point of view, we believe our silhouettes to be timeless. where the
customers can wear them without discarding fast fashion items. and we try our best to keep
them versatile so that their usage is maximised. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_28_Designer_1-2-1_Niroshini_Perera.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Niroshini Perera
Apr 27 2021. Self-taught designer Niroshini Perera trained and worked as a marketing
professional. However, her true love for fashion persuaded her to take a leap of faith and
create her own brand Isle of Design by Niro. Launched in 2019 Niro has continued to create
a fashionable clothing line with a modern twist incorporating traditional batik crafts
with contemporary designs giving it an interesting new spark. What sparked your interest
in fashion design? I was always interested in art and design and used to paint as a hobby,
and I love traditional crafts like batik, beeralu and patchwork. What made you take
fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? I am a marketing professional, and I
had a long career in consumer marketing with an MBA from the Postgraduate Institute of
Management. I enjoyed my work very much. But somewhere down the line I wanted a change,
wanted a bit more time for my family. This change also gave me more time for my hobby
which I was passionate about. How has work evolved since you began your own label? I
started spending a bit more time on my hobby working on some batik dresses and sarees for
a circle of friends, and that’s how it all began. Are there any types of design that you
avoid designing? I have not really thought of it like that. It's more what I like to do. I
like working with batik in cotton and silk. I also like working with beeralu lace and
patchwork. Where do you look for creative inspiration? Creative inspiration is everywhere,
but nature has always been a big part of my inspiration. Describe your latest collection?
It’s nature-inspired. It's the sea and the sky. I like to call it “Sky song by the sea”.
Who is your muse? It’s people you meet, your friends and of course, mother nature. What
are your sustainability credentials? I have started on my own only just a year ago, but we
are taking baby steps in this direction. We are currently working on a small sustainable
production to create our designs. Almost all of the artisans are females. We are also
constantly looking at working with sustainable dyes. What are you fascinated by at the
moment and how does it feed into your work? I am more an artist than a designer. I am
always mesmerized by nature and by femininity in all its expressions and hues and truly
delight in all articulations and manifestations of beauty. So while I am not a trained
designer, it‘s this you see in my work. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned
since you started your company? It’s a very short time since I started on this journey. I
think it is to be happy with what you have done so far. Don’t compare yourself with
others. Learn from your mistakes and move on… and note the importance of attention to
detail no matter how small the project is... What is your motto? To work with a sense of
passion and integrity. Which international or local designers are you inspired by? There
are many, Victoria Beckham for her unique style. Audrey Hepburn for her so many different
classic looks. Sonali Dharmawardena for her artistic batik, and Jai and Sathya Paul for
their vibrant colours and designs. What role do you think social media plays in fashion
today? Social media brings diversity and innovation to our community. It helps people to
engage with brands and trends that are happening around us. Many brands like us are able
to market their products via Facebook and Instagram. Social media also helps brand
engagement which also brings publicity to the brand. The lockdown was an ideal time period
that proved how effectively social media can be used by brands. Not only for brand
engagements but also for increased online purchasing as infrastructure improves, cash on
delivery etc What is your favourite part of being a designer? Making the pictures that pop
in my head a reality, and also seeing a happy smile on our customers How do you want women
to feel when wearing your clothes? She should feel her best and be confident and happy,
celebrating her unique style. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in

Shibori, a technique that now defines Echchampulle’s distinctive aesthetic. Dedicated to
sustainable practices, Echchampulle crafts low or zero waste garments featuring intricate,
abstract prints rooted in traditional techniques. Although Thisaru earned a BSc in
Logistics from Dailan Maritime University in China, his passion for transforming fabrics

Feb 28 2022. Agra by Nilusha Championing minimal waste patterns, Maddumage Nilusha
embraces sustainable design with unbridled passion. Her clothing can be worn in multiple
ways, a buckle here and a button there change the entire outlook of each outfit making it
a multifaceted garment. Deriving inspiration from a recent trip to Jaffna, the collection
strives to embrace the innocence, purity, true spirit of Jaffna and the positivity and the
sensitivity Indi felt during her exploration of the city. Portraying a fierce mood using a
soft to bold colour palette, the silhouettes were structured to depict the vision of the
collection. Charini Suriyage Inspired by her love for experimenting with combinations of
the traditional and modern, Charini has made a mark for herself in the ethical fashion
arena. She presented silhouettes embodying fluidity - a key aesthetic in the brand,
CHARINI. Inspired by nature this collection uses images from wildlife photographer,
Sarinda Unamboowe, whose respect and passion for the subject of wildlife and its
photography made this a like-minded collaboration. Himashi Wijeweera Known for her use of
beeralu lace this collection was inspired by the colour combinations found in the cosmic
horizon. This collection marks a highlight in Himashi’s fashion journey as this contained
some of her best ever work. The Silhouettes are kept simple in order to mainly focus on
the embellishments and they vary from bodycon silhouettes to flowy and fluid silhouettes
showcasing different potentials of the textural combinations. Hameedia - Fouzul Hameed The
grandmaster of men’s fashion in Sri Lanka, unassuming and humble, Fouzul Hameed continues
to do what he does best - creating impeccable men’s clothing. With the use of bright and
expressive colours using light cotton and breathable linens with an emphasis on
sustainability, the collection captures and conveys the ambience of a beautiful day in
Milan. Sonali Dharmawardena One of the finest contemporary batik designers whose abstract
designs have often been compared to wearable art Sonali’s collection was inspired by
memories of Sri Lanka’s unique wildlife and terrain which are ingrained in her memory from
her childhood. Suket Dhir Celebrated Indian designer Suket Dhir, no stranger to CFW
showcased his Forever Young collection which celebrates the resplendent youth which we all
come into, but few devote our every breathing moment in pursuit of excellence. The
aesthetic of the miniatures and the story is inspired by Olympus, the city of Greek Gods -
the sculpture-like athletic bodies, the sporting culture, adorned with jewellery inspired
by temple sculptures. The comic treatment lends playfulness to the storytelling. Overall
romanticism ties up the whole narrative. Zaheer Abbas Pakistani based designer Zaheer
Abbas was inspired by coming back to a semblance of normality after two tumultuous years
of the pandemic. The clothes themselves show that the language of beauty is a multi-
faceted drama of creation and renewal, remembering and forgetting. All of the pieces are
made of the humble cotton fabric, comfortably and uncritically adorned solely by hand
screen prints of floral vines and fauna motifs. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_28_Jaish_Parathalingam_Jayesingha.pdf,"Jaish Parathalingam Jayesingha
Oct 10 2017. S mart and sassy, diminutive, Jaish is the designer behind the Aashkii label.
Known for her flamboyant colours, styles and designs, for Jaish colour is everything. Her
new collection Seasand is a departure from her usual colourful vibe but yet she remains
true to her design aesthetic as she unveils a collection of linen wear that is effortless
chic and cool in a range of flattering silhouettes. What made you embark on a career in
fashion? I’ve always had a knack for fashion from curating my own wardrobe as a
professional stylist would, to collecting designer pieces and even creating my very own
bespoke pieces. Friends and family would approach me on different fashion related queries
be it helping them out to create an outfit or to maybe sharing my knowledge on one.
Describe this new collection? Raw and boundless as the shifting sands under the warm
island sun, yet effortlessly cool SEASAND by Aashkii is for someone who keeps pushing the
envelope and likes to keep it busy. For the grounded maverick in all of us this linen-wear
label will feature a divergent collection of silhouettes and cuts of great quality. How
long have you been a designer? I’ve always been designing for friends and family as long
as I remember. But I started retailing my designs almost six years ago. What inspired this
collection? My inspiration has often been derived by a global mood board and my backyard
which is this lush island that I call home. But SEASAND as the name implies is inspired by
the stunning shores of Sri Lanka. The constant switch between the serendipity and serenity
of my island home and its beautiful beaches is something that has always had me in awe and
I only hope to translate this through the collection and its chic attributes. What are the
challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri Lanka? Sri Lanka has great
potential for local labels than it did before. Keeping my team motivated to accept that
reception and this new fast paced environment is a challenge that I am facing at the
moment. Where do you retail your stuff? At Aashkii No1, Maitland Crescent, Colombo 7 and
at The Design Collective store at Stratford Avenue, Colombo 06. What is your top fashion
tip? Stay elegant, stay simple but moreover stay the way you are. Your dress sense should
define you and not another. Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? Hikkaduwa. Why the
transition from evening Glam to Beachwear? SEASAND is not restricted to just beachwear but
is also chic linen-wear that has the versatility to be styled into evening Glam. Fashion
prediction for the next season? I feel like tassels are making a comeback. Not just as
embellishments but also as jewellery. I’ve started to incorporate tassels into my designs
and also use them as an accessory in my daily wardrobe. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

Oct 28 2018. Mixing both young and established designers, Day 2 of Mercedes Benz Fashion
Week Sri Lanka, saw a host of fine fashion collections grace the runway. The use of
artisanal crafts such as beeralu lace, batik and handloom fabric featured high on the
agenda for every designer that showcased on Day 2. While some played it safe using muted
colour palettes, others created a riot of colour on the runway through their innovative
use of prints and myriad colour combinations. Henrik Vibskov Danish fashion designer
Henrik Vibskov presented pieces from his latest collection which he showcased at Paris
Fashion Week. Vibskov is currently working on a collaboration with AOD where Lankan
handloom becomes the material of choice for the award-winning fashion designer. KÛR by
Kasuni Rathnasuriya Using her beeralu or bobbin lace, this collection titled BizLeisure
was a hybrid collection for an empowered woman who enjoys business and leisure travel. Hot
on the heels after showcasing at New York Fashion Week, Kasuni presented looks which
ranged from business casual to urban exploration or a beach front dinner. Suave and
sophisticated this collection showcased an age old Sri Lankan artisanal craft to full
effect. Fernandorochelle by Rochelle Fernando Inspired by the traditional Sri Lankan
dress, the “sarama, Reddha-Hatte, osariya, saraiya, nilame (Mul)anduma, but developed more
along the lines of contemporary fusion this collection titled Tradition in Modernity
showcased a collection of adventurous silhouettes in pure linen in earthy colour tones.
‘ITR' by Khyati Pande Indian designer Khyati Pande presented her latest collection using
handwoven Khadi muslin, silk, hand block printed silk organza which were fused with dainty
hand embroidered motifs. Intricate details and layering were a key feature this collection
titled The Memory Keeper. Ann Mendis Kudos to this designer who is not afraid to mix and
match the brightest of colours to full effect. Canary yellows, emerald greens, fuchsia and
cobalt blue were using in varying combinations to display her prints which were based on
old Ceylonese stamps. Using screen prints, batik and upcycled handloom, Anne’s collection
was the brightest in more ways than one. Raidha's Maldives Presenting her collection
Victorian.Greenhouse.Honeycombs, this designer has successfully made the hijab and non
hijab looks very chic. Hers was a collection that had an element of high fashion in it.
She has used lots of appliqué, handworks, prints and embroidery fabric with lace trims and
French lace. U D n K by Umanga Kulasekera Fusing different hues to maximum effect, this
collection titled Metanoia embraces an optimistic, upbeat mood focused on improving one’s
spirit. The range is inspired by the new generation of women who expect brands to take a
stand both socially and ethically. The range consists of a fusion of mood enhancing
tailoring and a hint of unapologetic brights appearing within earthy tones. Tharshana
Wijesinghe Emerging as one of Sri Lanka’s finest young illustrators, Tharshana’s
collection Eclectic Journey showcased his ability to illustrate flora and fauna which
ensured he created some fine fabrics to complement his bold silhouettes. Using a delicate
colour palette he breathed life into his fabrics by using pops of colour in an intelligent
way. Linen Atelier by Punya Athukorala Playing it safe with a muted colour palette, this
collection was brought to life with the use of beeralu lace. Her choice of fabric was
exclusively linen and her Tropical Yarn collection was inspired by the “Simple” but
“Strong” woman. Poornima Wijendra Daring to be bold, this designer’s collection was all
about mixing and matching prints in various bold hues. Infusing ancient Tibetan colours
and symbols for harmony and prosperity, Poornima’s activation art is embedded into the
fabric as prints, to create a thematic energy activation clothing collective towards human
wellbeing. Common Folk by Thamali Dharmawardena Using an autumnal colour palette with pops
of blue ranging from indigo to ink blue, this collection titled Season 1 contained mix and
match separates in various silhouettes. Maheen Khan This Bangladeshi designer presented a
vintage look that floats easily in tropical travels. Her collection stood out due to thevibrant colours of varying shades of pink she used. Her collection was titled the Royal
Patterns of Bangladesh which boast of complex elemental designs that are unique to her
heritage. Bold and bright, her collection was all about colour which she used in the most
dramatic way. Charini Suriyage This designer is not afraid to use colour and mix and match
her prints. She has used various forms of ancient Sri Lankan temple art presented in an
abstract format. The silhouettes are contemporary and versatile. A combination of eco
conscious techniques such as sublimation printing along with craft base techniques such as
batik, tie dye and beeralu (pillow lace) are used in this collection. Upasana Design
Studio by Uma Prajapati A monochromatic collection in red and white this collection is
rooted in the multicultural Auroville, Upasana where the creativity, design, Indian
culture, business, social responsibility and spiritual progress get woven together. A
clever play between the engineered and the raw Khadi, this collection features structured
elements with silhouettes derived from origami introducing additional structure with the
taut appearing pin-tucks, coupled with natural, untouched elements. Ramona Oshini Her
Exotic Islander collection was inspired by the murals at Helga's Folly. The floral motifs
created by Ramona pays testament to her artistic credentials. The techniques used to bring
this collection to life are Sri Lankan batik created and drawn by Ramona and then
embroidered using rich coloured thread work on the batik and batik appliqués. The
silhouettes are perfect for resort island wear and could carry from day to night as all
fabrics used are natural fibers such as pure silk or silk cotton Natalie Goonetilleke Fun
and quirky are the words that best describe this collection titled Suit Up Tropics.
Inspired by Teddy girl Subculture from the 1950s and infusing tropical prints inspired by
the lotus flower and insects from The Island of Sri Lanka. This capsule collection is a
fusion of femininity fused with sharp tailoring and sporty silhouettes that is made for
the urban professional woman. Urban Island Striking the right balance between the use of
colour and fun silhouettes, this Island Collection renders a contemporary tropical travel
life style, by bringing together heritage textile techniques, natural materials and
contemporary design. A blend of modern and timeless aesthetics tastefully curated from all
things designed, made and handcrafted in Sri Lanka. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

life_fashion90_29_Business_in_the_New_Normal.pdf,"Business in the New Normal
May 21 2020. With life limping back to normal after 8 weeks of lockdown, the fashion
industry is cautiously dipping its toes into a post-COVID-19 retail environment. For many
stores, the two months of lockdown has spelled disaster with several closing down due to
lack of trade. For stores that had rented properties in Colombo paying exorbitant rents,
the death knell was sounded at the 4-week mark when they realised that they would find it
nigh on impossible to continue trading. Left with stock and no way of selling their goods
many small businesses have resorted to e-commerce. This involves no rent, utility bills
and a great reduction in staff costs Some of Sri Lanka’s leading designers have used the
lockdown period to reflect and re-examine their direction. The thread that unites most of
the designers Life spoke to is the fact they all want to create garments with an increased
sustainability factor. A relative newcomer to the scene Dishnira Saparamadu the owner of
Thambili Island says the pandemic has raised awareness of the importance to support local
businesses. “ The pandemic has opened my eyes to how important it is to support our local
businesses. It has inspired me to look into more locally sustainable options for fabric
and further develop our community outreach. Thambili Island is built on two pillars that
are very dear to my heart, ethical fashion, and community empowerment, I want to focus our
energy on further extending our influence. We are all in this together, and we will all
come out of this together stronger than ever. “ With the advent of Covid-19, the world was
introduced to a much-bandied phrase – the new normal. In encapsulates how the world will
realign themselves to the new post-COVID -19 world. Looking at alternative ways to market
their products is high on the agenda for many stores. Many were only just raising their
heads from the Easter bombings when the pandemic brought about economic devastation which
forced smaller businesses like Ripe to rethink their strategies. Growing a community of
like-minded vendors, Ripe had evolved to housing many young design brands and was
providing a healthy space for upcoming designers to showcase their wares. Thinking smart
and quick off the block in gearing up to face the new normal, Sharmilla Ruberu, the co-
founder of Ripe has taken a radical decision to move to e-commerce which she believes will
be more viable for her business. “We have decided to move to e-commerce to continue
trading. This way we reduce our overheads, we get to work from home and above all the
saving we make can be passed on to our customers which would be welcome for everyone given
the fact that the economy is virtually in the doldrums”. New York-based Sri Lankan fashion
designer also Kasuni Rathnasuriya, whose label KUR produces some exquisite clothing that
incorporates artisanal crafts such as bobbin lace is also looking to online platforms to
market her clothing. “Online and digital platforms are very important. Virtual showroom
and digital storytelling will be in demand as travel restrictions around the world will
mean a few footfalls. By using social media we can work towards increasing our virtual
footfall”. For Sri Lankan designers like Charini Suriyage whose eponymous label Charini is
a fixture in many of Colombo’s fashionable closets, having a physical store is a must.
Given the nature of her business where she creates bespoke clothing, her clients have to
come in for measurements and fit-ons. Dealing with health and safety issues is a prime
concern for Charini. “We have a small coterie of staff and they all follow the rules of
social distancing and sanitisation very carefully. In the store, we have introduced
sanitisation points and we will follow international guidelines of running a clothing
business. We will train staff to adhere to all safety measures so that our clients will be
assured of a safe retail experience which is more important now more than ever. Tina

Aug 22 2018. Featuring - Sanathana Batiks Today on Fashionably Danu, I feature work by
Kanchana Fernando. I’m using some old t-shirts to create new magic. I saw her work with
LICC and wanted her to be on this for some time. I love the fact that her clothing has a
second chance – and anything could be made into something fashionable and new. Its not
about creating designs, but its also about looking at what’s more sustainable and Up-
Cycling is a great way, and I'm loving the collection today. A big thank you to LICC for
taking such concepts to the market 1. What would you say is your fashion statement? Its
fairly simple. All I want to be and be known for is for being “sustainably unique”. 2.
When did you partner up with LiCC, how has it been working with jeans and Batik? We
launched our 1st collection back in Feb 2018 and it has been a great journey so far. In my
opinion, LICC is the best local denim brand in Sri Lanka, and I believe it has and will
help me on two fronts; one in adding value to the product and the marketing of upcycled
denims. 3. What would you say is missing in Men’s Fashion in Sri Lanka? As a designer do
you feel men in Lanka dare to dress differently? I feel men’s fashion in Srilanka is bit
mainstream and tend to follow the same trends and designs over the years. Anyway, I
strongly believe that Men’s fashion needs to be taken out of the usual comfort zone and
new things need to be tried. Hence, I felt I would fail as a designer if I don’t try to be
that catalyst, and then came the concept of men’s tie-up slippers and heram pants. 4. Tell
me about your brand, and its name? My, actually our brand goes by the name “Sanathana
Batik”. It was started by my parents as more of a hobby and a lifestyle, back in 1985. I
was involved extensively in this venture since I was a little girl and its sort of my
first love. We do a range of products under this brand, from wall hangings to dresses,
tops, shirts and & Sarees. Once I started actively working for our brand, I introduced
Batik slippers and Accessories. The biggest breakthrough came to the “Sanathana batiks”
when I started upcycled denim wear. 5. Where are you selling your products? I sell my own
upcycled collections at good market and international trade fairs. And the “LICC Batik by
Kanch” collections are up for grabs at the LICC online store. 6. When you say, “Up-
Cycling” what do you mean? How did you come up with this idea I collect used old denim
products and redesign them using batik techniques. The very recent partnering with LICC is
about redesigning their rejected garments to create a sustainable line for LICC. There is
a story to it actually. Around two-three years back one of my favorite Jeans was ruined by
a stain mark and I didn’t want to get rid of it. So out of curiosity, I re-designed it
with Batik. That was a “light bulb” moment for me and since then I started my collections
of upcycled denims. 7. What is the process of creating and marketing your design? Your
design inspiration I take a different approach to design than the traditional designing
process. I do not research specifically for the collection. And I do not like to tie
myself down to specific seasons. My design inspiration is more in the moment, sort of,
where I look at the person /purpose and my mood, then I let my mind run with it. Also,
sustainability is a key variable in the design process. 8. Who do you envision wearing
creations? I simply adore people who share the same ethical living values as I do.
Therefore, anyone who believes if the concept of sustainable living and ethical clothing
is more than welcome to wear my outfits. 9. Tell me about the collection you have featured
on the shoot today? Like I said before, my intention is to revolutionize Men’s fashion in
SL. So, today’s collection is a very casual men’s wear collection designed using a
combination of free style art & traditional art. To highlights in the shoot are the batik
gladiator slippers and the Harem pants which are not the most common among men… yet. But I
would love to set a trend where guys will be bold enough to wear new silhouettes. 10.
Whats going to be next in the world of fashion for you? I am already heavily involved in
Women’s fashion, so next would be an increased focus on Men’s fashion. And take both Men’sand Women’s upcycled trend to the international market. I also have an idea to put one
foot into interior designing as well, which I am currently working on. More news on that
later ;) Designer – Kanchana Fernando Photographer – Arantha Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a

Dec 20 2017. Today I take up 80s rock for the shoot. I loved her collection on the runway
at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka as it was her final year collection. ‘Velvet
Stardust’ was an androgynous menswear collection inspired by the 80s glam rock with
inspiration from David Bowie, Boy George, Roxy Music, The Factory - Andy Warhol’s Tin Foil
Studio, Malcolm McLaren’s Buffalo Gals and the 80s Buffalo Culture together with a mix of
elements consisting tailoring, outerwear and workwear together with textile surfaces such
as sublimation, foil, digital printing, hand knit and machine embroidery. The shoot was
fun and here is the very young designer. 1. How was studying at AOD? Studying at AOD was a
totally different experience, I learnt everything from the fundamentals of design to
creating my own collection at AOD and there are no restrictions on what you can and can't
do. We’ve always been taught the right way to do what we really want. 2. As many make it
their number one choice, what made you take up men's wear? I’ve always been crazy about
menswear and I would say a very large portion of my work even at AOD consisted of it. In
Sri Lanka, I believe there is not enough variety of menswear and I wanted to try out all
the possible ways to dress men up and it's somewhat a challenge as it all comes down to
attention to detail and the little things and I really enjoy the excitement menswear
brings with it. 3. What are the items you have featured on me today? We featured garments
from my graduate collection like The Macleod Trucker Jacket (with multiple patch pocket
details, metal zips on sleeve cuff and MacLeod Clan crest embroidered on the right sleeve
and red bar tack details), Spiders from Mars” Sleeveless Hooded Jacket with dark indigo
denim and oil silk foil printed hound’s-tooth printed lined with sublimation printed
taffeta, Chameleon Motorcycle Jacket with double Asymmetric Lapels and Knit Rib Panel,
Epaulets and Velt Zipper Pockets. Machine embroidery of Buffalo Girls album art on the
back of the jacket and the Starman Park, i.e. a hooded khaki parka mix media digital all
over prints and Aqua Marine Foil Prints. I also featured my diffusion collection -
consisting of Screen-printed, Tie Dyed and Foil Printed T-shirts and Totes. 4. You put me
in heels for the shoot, tell me the story there? I wanted to portray an androgynous style
with my garments and keeping with the 80s rock and roll, I had to make sure that I stick
to the true style of my muse David Bowie. I’ve always liked the idea of Men in heels. 5.
How would you describe your personal style? When it comes to designing, my personal style
is always very androgynous and rock and roll and I always like to use pop culture and
music with a retrospective aspect in my designs. I also like to associate myself with
street style athleisure. 6. Can you customize designs on request? I have not done any
customized designs yet, but if I do get the chance,I would love to do it. 7. Who has been
your biggest inspiration when it comes to fashion? My muse is David Bowie. I always find
myself looking for inspiration from designers like Raf Simons, Virgil Abloh, Demna
Gvasalia and Marc Jacobs. 8. What has been the feedback for your collection? Quite
overwhelming, as it is my first ever collection and it's always so nice to get positive
feedback from people for the work you do. Everyone loved the heels I think. 9. What
according to you is a favourite part of being a fashion designer? Being able to express
myself through the form of fashion. 10. What's next for the brand? As for now I’m working
on my t-shirt line and it’s a street style diffusion collection that I launched with
printed t-shirts and totes at 'Reveal 2017' and I’m hoping to expand that collection with
a wider range of garments. Social Media Handles: Facebook: Nimna Wickramasinghe Instagram:

life_fashion90_29_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring__-_Four_in_Hand.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - Four in Hand
Sep 27 2017. It's amazing when young people come forward and do interesting things. Dulan
is one person who had an issue with finding ties in Sri Lanka and decided that guys who
rotate between two ties all their professional lives should find a way to be fashionable.
And so the brand 'Four in Hand' was born. This 22 year old struggles with balancing two
full time jobs - one in financial services and the other at 'Four In Hand'. You can buy
his collection online and the finish is of international standard. XIris and I worked on
the shoot with a new look, focusing on the tiny details. What’s with the name “Four in
Hand”? So everyone knows the most mainstream tie knots, or at least they should! You’ve
got 'The Windsor', 'The Elridge', 'The Half Windsor' and a couple of others. The ones I
named are slightly more complex to wrap your head around. The most simple tie-knot though,
the basic schoolboy knot, that most of us learnt to tie when we were younger is actually
called the 'Four in Hand' knot. I wanted a name that signified simplicity and versatility
in every situation, because I wanted that to be what our products were about. In my
opinion the Four in Hand Knot is just that. The symmetry of the knot, I feel, surpasses
all other knots and fits every occasion. So I figured why not 'Four In Hand'. Tell me
about your collection which you have featured in this shoot? There isn’t a fixed theme to
the collection or something in particular that inspired me to produce the ties that were
shot today. The tie collection featured today is more a hybrid of the two collections I
released prior to this one. My first collection was purely knitted ties. My second
consisted of the more conventional pieces. With this collection, I’m incorporating both
the styles of ties along with a bunch of different designs that I feel are a bit
adventurous for men in terms of local fashion. Paisleys, floral, stripes and a whole bunch
of uncommon colours to go with them. I want to develop an environment for guys to push the
limits of what they think is appropriate or trending. I don’t think you need to be wearing
what’s “in fashion” at the moment, because fashion itself is something that evolves with
time.The way I see it, you’re either doing one of two things with how you dress. You’re
either setting a trend or following one that already exists. I dunno about anyone else but
I would rather be the trendsetter and this is what the whole collection is trying to do.
Give everyone the opportunity to make an impression. As a brand, how many pieces do you
put out in every collection? Do you also custom make? So we don’t produce huge quantities
of every different style. We want to have a variety of different looks but also produce
limited quantities to add a touch of exclusivity. I mean you don’t want to be walking into
a room and looking at another guy wearing the same tie as you, especially if it is a
standout piece. I’m sorry, but at this point we don’t do custom ties, maybe sometime in
the future though. Tell me the story, what made you start this? Well to state the obvious,
I love my ties. And I really enjoy the whole process of putting oneself together. The
simple process of picking the right tie to go with my shirt everyday is something I
genuinely put a lot of thought and interest into. And I know quite a few guys like that,
who make a conscious effort to dress, not to outshine others but because they really enjoy
the process. I also know quite a few guys who enjoy it, but are afraid to experiment or do
something a little unusual. I think 'Four In Hand' was started for them. To give them a
reason to muster up a little courage and really express themselves with what they wear. I
know you are only online now. Do you see 'Four in Hand' moving into a retail store?
There’s a lot of things 'Four In Hand' has got in its pipeline. We are on the fence about
retail though. I’ve done a whole load of research and I’ve heard a lot of reviews. There’s
ups and downs to the move. But I like to experiment and see how it might impact the brand
so the move to a retail store might take place. Just not yet. 7. What would you say to
those who shuffle two ties at work? There's so much value that you can give yourself by
just making a conscious effort to look good. If you don't take yourself seriously enoughto wear more than two ties at work, when there's close to 365 days of work in a year, I
don't think anybody else should take you seriously. 8. What is the process of creating and
marketing your design? Your design inspiration The process is quite on the go. I'm trying
to balance a full time job along with running 'Four In Hand' so a lot of the things I do
for marketing are done in and around my full time job and the rest of my day. It's like I
get up in the morning, get dressed for work, slip on a tie and my girlfriend, Nipunee,
will snap a quick picture of that tie or I'll get a friend to take a picture of my outfit
at work. I've honestly never been a fan of standing and posing for pictures but, it's
gotta be done. And now I'm not too uncomfortable to be honest. Besides that, I do alot of
product photography during the weekends or at work. The rest of my social media marketing
is done whenever and wherever. I consciously make the time, even when I'm swamped with
other work. I really don't mind, because it's something I'm super interested in. For
inspiration, I look to a lot of things. I look to the people around me. I look to social
media. I have a few particular people I follow religiously, like Perkens Bien Aime and
Blake Scott. Check them out! I also took a lot of inspiration from the city I did my
Bachelors in. Melbourne was a place full of culture, all the way from the coffee to the
way people dress. I hope I get the chance to show the people here at home a lot of the
stuff I caught onto when I lived back there. 9. Who do you envision wearing your work? Do
you think about this when you work on designs? I envision conservatives wearing them. By
conservatives, I mean, people that don't like to take risks with their clothes. In my
head, that's my target market. Having said that, I don't want to produce safe designs that
I think anybody and everybody would choose to wear. To put it simply, I envision a man
that is afraid to try something new or different to the social norm but does it anyway and
leaves a lasting impact. 10. What would you say are 5 important items which need to be in
any man's wardrobe? I think every guy should have, A pair of loafers/ boat shoes A set of
tapered pants A well fitted button-down long sleeve shirt A blazer that demands attention
And, last but not least he's got to have a knitted tie Designer – Dulan Perera

life_fashion90_29_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring__-_IKIGAI.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - IKIGAI
Sep 24 2019. Today I’m excited about featuring a very talented designer who has a swag
about her I love! Sandani Perera is a designer who believes in Refine silhouettes, a less
is more attitude and intricate construction, which best describes her brand DNA. The looks
are simple, easy so island friendly , and its so well cut and stitched, you can dress it
down on a Sunday or dress it up for a party. IKIGAI is a men’s and women’s ready to wear
brand that launched its debut collection at Urban island ,Colombo in March 2019. Prior to
that the brand showcased at MBFRSL 2016 ,graduate, Emerging Talent runway as well as for
MBFRSL 2018 as an emerging designer You can get her new collection soon at Urban island
and if you like what’s featured on this shoot, check out her section at Urban Island 1.
What made you start Ikigai, what’s the story? When I was 12 and almost everyone around me
wanted to be a doctor, lawyer or marketer, I wanted to be a fashion designer. My parents
thought it was a phase, but being a designer and having my own brand and creating clothes
was all I ever wanted to do.So many years later here I am. 2. How do you pick finalise on
the colours? My personal taste in colour is monochrome and neutral. I think it influences
IKIGAI’s colour palette to a great extent. I like my designs to be as refined and chic as
possible, and I think colour plays a major role in keeping it at that. I have no
restrictions though, I will add colour depending on the theme, trends or season, but it
will always be subtle and nothing too noisy. No matter what the colour pallet is, I always
make limited pieces of each design in black simply because it feels right and everything
looks great in black. 3. How did you work on the blocks? And do you take made to measure
orders? We do a number of fit trials to make sure we get the right fit, and sizes range
from S to XL. We are hoping to introduce 2XL as well. If any other size is required we can
definitely customise the order. 4. What role do you think social media plays in fashion
today? And how has business been online – Social media plays a huge role in fashion
whether you are an entrepreneur or customer. It makes the world of fashion far more
accessible and closer no matter which part of the world you may be from. Sure there may be
a few negatives, but honestly I don’t worry about them because the positives outweigh
them. I have had some amazing people message me with encouraging and motivating messages
and sharing images of them wearing my designs. It is honestly the best feeling! I don’t
currently sell online but if a client requires a specific size or design that is sold out
in store they are able to contact me on Instagram or facebook and I will make arrangements
to get it across to them. 5. Tell me about the collection I am Dressed in for this
feature? The feature is of our 2nd series, which had a tropical theme. The colour palette
was a representation of IKIGAI’s interpretation of our little island Sri Lanka. We stayed
true to our brand Identity, by keeping silhouettes and construction clean and refined. 6.
The market is very crowded with a lot of shirt brands, how do you stand out, what makes
you different? Our target customer is someone who has a less is more attitude, and truly
appreciates the minimal aesthetic of our designs, and someone who pays attention to subtle
but intricate detailing. As a designer I don’t want IKIGAI to be just a shirt brand, I
want it to be a feeling-one that boosts its wearer’s confidence. 7. What advice would you
give someone who is buying shirts off the rack or online , What should they keep in mind
when one picks shirts for them? Collar size!!! Collar size!!! Collar size!!! And things
like sleeve preference (long, short, fitted, folded, over sized, etc) and preferred fit
(dress shirt, slim fit, dropped shoulder, length, etc) 8. What do you keep in mind when
you pick your fabrics? And what would you say is the biggest issue - finding the fabrics
or getting the quantity you need? Quality + Comfort + Colour. In that exact order. I would
say finding the fabric is harder especially because I am so specific about the colour and
the quality of fabric I want to use. Quantity is not an issue since I only make a maximum
of 10 pieces of each design in a specific colour. 9. What are the most selling colours andprints? The pine and olive volume dresses and striped men’s shirts from series II sold out
super fast. 10. Would you be getting into any other areas of fashion - or would it always
be shirts and pants? IKIGAI does both men’s and women’s ready to wear, and we retail at
Urban Island. You can find us on instagram and facebook @ikigaibysandaniperera I also
design bridals and evening wear under IKIGAI bridal 11. Tell me about your bridal brand,
how can one get in touch with you? IKIGAI Bridal is a chic, modern, minimal bridal and
evening wear brand. It is the brain child of combining my passion for design and love for
weddings. Elegance and simplicity are words the brand is founded on and you can find us,
and get in touch on instagram or facebook @ikigai_bridal 12. Your top 5 for a man in his
wardrobe? A well fitted white T-shirt Well fitted pair of chinos A pair of jeans A nice
dress shirt A nice pair of loafers Name of the designer: Sandani Perera Photographer –

life_fashion90_29_HARID_-_A_designer_collection_that_promotes_local_heritage.pdf,"HARID - A designer collection that promotes local heritage
Mar 29 2022. Having been inspired by the intricacies of the Kandyan saree often worn by
his grandmother, Harinda Gunawardena was determined to pursue a career in fashion after
A/Ls. His aspirations bore fruition with the launch of his own label HARID which is a
brand that promotes self-love and being comfortable with oneself. However, the main brand
philosophy is a focus on local heritage crafts that have been incorporated into his
designs. In an interview with the Daily Mirror Life, Gunawardena shared the story of his
brand that blends fashion with sustainable design approaches. Q What inspired you to
become a fashion designer? As far as I can remember from a very young age I have been
quite artistic and I had a talent for art and design with a knack for creativity. Also, I
believe that a major influencing factor for me was my grandmother who used to dress in her
Kandyan Saree every day and I remember being quite fascinated with the intricacies of the
Kandyan saree and how it was draped. In addition to that, I used to watch her sew and was
quite interested in that as well. After my A-Levels I felt that a career in fashion was
best suited for me as it provided a platform not only to express my creativity in terms of
design and art but also for me it was a mode of communication and a form of expression. Q
Tell us about the ‘HARID’ collection. HARID by HARINDA GUNAWARDENA is a brand that
believes in and fosters self-love and confidence whilst promoting the value of being
comfortable with oneself. I firmly believe that in today’s day and age we need to practice
the concept of self-love and be comfortable with who we are. Apart from that, HARID is
inspired by everything that revolves around us concentrating on one’s emotions and
feelings. The designs which come to life through HARID communicate these values in their
intricate forms. In addition to that, the main brand philosophy of HARID is to focus on
the unique heritage craft practices which are iconic to Sri Lanka. As a designer and a
brand, I have always had the urge to transform these craft practices through a more modern
approach, in order for them to be elevated to the international fashion area, as I feel
that there is a lot of scope and opportunity for local heritage craft practices to be
developed further. Incorporating and highlighting local heritage craft practices through
structured and fluid silhouettes along with bold quirky colours and batik designs to
create a signature style is what my design approach is. My latest collection highlights a
powerful style of fashion-focused on expressing identity and portraying self-confidence
regardless of gender and focuses on Modern Day power dressing. This collection not only
focuses on my interpretation of modern-day power dressing but concentrates on uplifting
local craft practices to a global arena through the designs. Q Tell us about your
experience at CFW. My initial showcase was at the CFW 2020 Summer where I incorporated
Batik craft into an androgynous collection. This was my initial collection, I actually
expressed a very young and cheeky vibe through this collection where I incorporated a
colourful mustache and lip batik design on the garments, and when the batik designs were
completed and the garments were turned out I was actually surprised cause it had turned
out better than I expected, with quite the elegance to it. Then in 2021, I had the
opportunity to showcase at the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka where I drove further
into local heritage craft practices and developed a conceptual collection based on hand
weaving incorporating locally practiced techniques of Pick-up motifs technique and
Gatapismentu technique. This collection was focused on gender fluidity and the outfits
which were showcased were developed in a manner where one could easily express themselves.
From then to now I have gained tremendous experience through showcasing at CFW and learned
a lot about the industry in general as CFW has provided me with great exposure to the
industry and many opportunities. Q There’s a dialogue about sustainable fashion. How has
your collection stood in line with sustainable fashion practices? Sustainable fashion is
not a new trend or topic in the industry and it has been there for a while but now withthe current social trends this topic has gained quite the hype and consumers are now aware
of this and most consumers demand sustainable fashion. In the current ongoing dialogue
about sustainable fashion and through my experience working as a designer at MAS Holdings,
sustainability has been embedded into my design thinking process and it is one essential
aspect that I look at when working on my designs. A psychology graduate who eventually

life_fashion90_29_NAYANI_by_Nayani_Fernando.pdf,"NAYANI by Nayani Fernando
Dec 03 2018. Minimal seams, refined fabrics and sophisticated silhouettes seem to be the
hallmark of NAYANI. NAYANI is a ready-to-wear designer clothing brand founded by designer
Nayani Fernando in 2018. The brand as well as the designer are on a journey of learning
and growth, both commercially and creatively since the label started retailing and
connecting with a Sri Lankan clientele and fashion enthusiasts. Nayani started her career
as a designer with top notch credentials in place. She holds a BA (Hons) in Fashion Design
from the University of Salford, Manchester. Her final collection “Nothingness” was
showcased at London Graduate Fashion Week in 2014. This collection was also shortlisted
for the Limerick International Fashion Student awards, which was held in Ireland. She
launched her brand ""NAYANI"" this year which currently retails at The Design Collective.
Where did your interest in creative work and fashion design stem from? I started sketching
at a young age. Fashion and creative design have always been a part of my life since I can
remember. My mother used to stitch dresses for me and my sisters. Therefore it was second
nature for me to be around sewing machines, patterns and fabrics. Later on I started to
cultivate an interest in clothing; on how it would look better if it was stitched or
constructed in a particular way. It was not something that I had fully thought out but
deep down I’ve always had an affinity to this field. Why did you choose ladies wear as
your area of specialization? Womenswear has always been my forte and it is what I
specialized in when I was at university as well. I grew up with two sisters and one thing
I’ve learned is that we all have an individual sense of style that speaks to us that also
empowers us. Being able to tap into this concept and being able to incorporate this idea
into my designs has been a challenge for me but one that I have enjoyed. While I am
focused on womenswear right now, I someday hope to venture into menswear as well. What was
the learning experience like between graduating and launching your own label? After
graduating, I took part in the emerging designer segment at Colombo Fashion Week. It was
the first platform where I showcased my work after graduating therefore it was a valuable
and challenging experience as it gave me the opportunity to gauge whether my designs would
be attractive to the Sri Lankan market. I also worked at MAS for two years, which really
taught me the industry and I met the most wonderful people that have taught me lessons in
life that I don’t think I could have learnt anywhere else. Launching a label is a
commercial venture as much as it is a creative one. What are the lessons learnt? Sometimes
you will have to deviate a little bit from your creativity and think practically. However
it is important to never forget your brand identity. Yes, at the end of the day you have
to sell clothes, but it is important to stay true to yourself. Is there a niche you have
set your eyes on for future work and could you describe what interests you about this
chosen niche? I wouldn’t say that there is only one particular niche that interests me.
However I feel that there is a certain type of customer that is drawn to my designs and I
feel it’s the same with every other brand. You wear what suits you the best. A little bit
about the collection you feel is your best work yet? The work I presented at the London
Graduate Fashion Week collection would be my pick. The time and hard work I put into that
collection defined my style perfectly and shaped my career as a designer. It was my baby,
I truly figured out my personal style in that collection. Designing for Sri Lankan women;
what do you draw inspiration from? Personally I don’t differentiate and think, I'm
designing for a Sri Lankan woman in particular. I like to imagine all types of women from
different ages when I design. Sri Lankans are very true to their roots, we love our
heritage and culture. I try to always incorporate at least one of these aspects into my
garments by using a range of vibrant colours with free-flowing silhouettes to suit our
climate. It also always comes down to someone’s personal taste. I believe that building a
strong brand identity is very important. What are your future plans for ‘NAYANI’ thelabel? I hope to take NAYANI to an international stage and gauge the response to the
designs in overseas markets. Taking the brand one step further will be a challenge that I
look forward to embracing. By: Surekha Jayasinghe Your comment (*)",4580
life_fashion90_29_Stepping_Up_Essential_Footwear_for_the_Fashionable_Man_of_20.pdf,"Stepping Up: Essential Footwear for the Fashionable Man of 2024
Jun 11 2024. Nothing beats seeing a well-dressed man in Sri Lanka with his killer outfit
that’s complimented by… his ankle-high white socks and slip-on black shoes. Yes, those are
the moments that remind me I need to politely discuss something that’s always been afoot
but often overlooked – How Men put no thought into what socks they pair with shoes! Yes,
those trusty soles that carry you from meetings to meetups, dates to dinners and even just
visiting someone at home; Those things that protect your feet and your reputation mean so
much more now. Here are the five essential pairs of footwear that every man should have in
their wardrobe in 2024 tailormade to Lankan sensibilities. The Black Lace Up Shoe It’s
like black underwear; We should all have one. Black lace-up shoes also called ‘Oxfords’ go
with anything, but that could be social conditioning since we are forced to wear them for
school from a very young age. Owning this pair is a must as it has a sense of formality to
it. Once this level is cleared in your wardrobe, I highly recommend getting a ‘Brogue’ (a
leather shoe that has punctured patterns on it). This will be your go-to for any formal
event or occasion you are required to dress up, even if it’s just a day for a special
meeting. If you only own slip-ons, I suggest getting one of these and feeling the
difference. PLEASE WEAR THESE WITH BLACK SOCKS THAT REACH ABOVE YOUR ANKLE. The Light
Brown Loafer If the black shoe is the work wife, the light brown loafer is your after-work
drink mate. By definition, the loafer is any shoe you have to slip on (without Velcro to
hold it in; because you’re not an invalid or a child) and it comes in a range of styles
like the Golf driver, Heeled, Tasseled, Penny & Loro Piana lookalike Loafer. Extra credit
if you can tell them all apart. As for why, it’s a nice break from being seen in your
black shoes and works well with business-casual looks, weekend looks that are either
shorts or denim and even with light-coloured suits and slacks. Since we are discussing
loafers, they were never meant to be worn with socks here in Sri Lanka even though I’ve
seen many a businessman try; Highly recommend investing in what are now called ‘invisible
socks’ just to avoid that sweaty feeling if it’s a humid affair. The White Sneaker Nothing
I hate more than hearing ‘deck shoes’ used to describe the most recent addition to men’s
wardrobes locally. And thankfully, there is no limit to which age you can be legally
allowed to wear them. Look for one that’s got less branding as possible. If it can be
leather or matte, it becomes very versatile wear for your outings that are not functions,
hanging out with friends or demands on your attendance that don’t need you to get all that
dressed up. I will allow a pair that doubles for athletic wear or basketball, but it will
only allow you to pair it with certain outfits and events. The Sports Slide Move over
leather sandals. Or any sandal. Unless you constantly traverse our beaches or prefer a
more airy approach to exploring our nature trails (at the peril of leeches and bugs),
sandals have died and been replaced with a sporty slip-on once required for locker rooms
and kids at the pool. They come in a range of aesthetically pleasing designs, and designer
logos and also some brands carry no branding at all. I would suggest a neutral dark colour
so it will not show wear and tear easily and be one step elevated from the traditional
rubber slipper we are so fond of showing out in public even as adults. Recently British PM
Rishi Sunak was spotted pairing tailored pants with Adidas Samba’s and the internet was
definitely not split on it; the whole world united to tell him he’d ruined a pair of
timeless shoes for more reasons than fashion. If you feel your shoes don’t get noticed
think again. With an understanding of our constantly yo-yoing costs and the demand of
looking good, I’m not saying the solution is buying more shoes but matching shoes with a
precision that speaks volumes about who you are even if all you want is to fade into
obscurity. Even if you own one pair of shoes, there are ways to make them fit seamlessly
into your lifestyle requirements. Indulge in a bit of research online today or speak to
that one fashionable friend you know. Fact: What you wear matters, down to the shoes. Afashion stylist with a decade of experience as an image expert and consultant to local

life_fashion90_29_Wardrobe_Warrior.pdf,"Wardrobe Warrior
Apr 07 2025. Sarita Rajendran's mission to empower Sri Lankan Women on personal style and
fashion A lifelong devotee of fashion, Sarita Rajendran used the quiet of the pandemic as
a chance to turn passion into purpose, qualifying as a certified stylist and deepening her
understanding of the art and science behind style. The experience was eye-opening—it
revealed just how much more there is to styling beyond surface-level aesthetics. This
journey sparked the idea for Wardrobe Warrior, a book that had been long in the making,
designed to empower Sri Lankan women with practical tools to build a wardrobe that
reflects their individuality, lifestyle, and budget. Written in both English and Sinhala,
Wardrobe Warrior fills a long-standing gap in fashion education in Sri Lanka. It caters to
a diverse audience—from women who can afford high-end wardrobes but lack guidance, to
those with limited means who still deserve to feel stylish and confident. The book offers
practical advice on dressing for different life stages and occasions, from pregnancy to
peri -menopause, and emphasizes working with, not against, South Asian body types and
cultural norms. Proceeds from the book support the training of new Dumbara weaving
artisans—a cause close to the author’s heart. Wardrobe Warrior is more than a style guide;
it's a celebration of self-expression, culture, and community. What inspired you to write
Wardrobe Warrior, and how long has the idea been in the making? I have always been an
ardent follower of fashion. During the pandemic, I took the opportunity to deepen my
understanding of the subject and qualified as a stylist. Through this course of study, I
discovered just how much there is to the art of styling. It made me realise that a book on
this topic—available in both English and Sinhala—would be a valuable resource, especially
for the women of our country. I also contribute some funding for thread used by the
Dumbara weavers when they train new artisans, most of the proceeds of these books will go
towards this exercise. 2. You’ve long been a fixture on Colombo’s best-dressed lists. How
does this book reflect your personal journey with fashion? The older you get, you become
more comfortable in your skin , your shape , dress size etc. I think I have addressed
issues that women face from what to wear to your workplace , pregnancy as well as Peri-
menopause . It is essential to understand all these elements, and as south Asians, our
bodies are made very differently to the west, therefore it is essential to understand
elements that define our culture and work around them instead of against it. 3. What do
you hope readers will take away from Wardrobe Warrior—is it more about confidence, style,
or self-expression? There is a large Sinhalese speaking population in the country who are
able to afford a beautifully curated wardrobe , but may not necessarily know how to curate
one. Likewise there are those who cannot afford to do the same. I have addressed how to
budget accordingly and written guidelines as how you can curate a wardrobe. 4. Can you
tell us about the process of curating the content for the book—how did you decide what
style advice to include? After I qualified as a certified stylist I learned a lot that I
didn't know about wardrobe curation. I also feel that a large part of the population in
Sri Lanka has access to beautiful clothes at very reasonable prices unlike 25 years ago.
But personal style is lacking and that is one of the reasons I decided to go ahead with
this publication in Sinhalese as well. It took me almost 2 years to compile the English
publication. 5. In a world dominated by fast fashion and trends, how does Wardrobe Warrior
encourage people to build a timeless, authentic wardrobe? You have to read the book to

life_fashion90_29_Why_every_style_is_not_for_everyone_and_the_impact_of_expres.pdf,"Why every style is not for everyone, and the impact of expressing your identity
with style
Feb 27 2018. What is your style identity? That’s a million dollar question for those of us
who are struggling to decipher our fashion persona. While others are dressed with seeming
ease in clothes that reflect their individual personalities, others try any trend that is
going and ends up looking like fashion victims. How does one avoid committing a fashion
faux pas? The idea of understanding your body and mind when the dressing is explored here
discussing how style is an essential expression of who you are. This should help women see
style as an extension of themselves, rather than what is trending or an outfit in their
favourite colour. Fashionmarket.lk recently launched their Women’s day campaign ‘Wear your
Super Power’ (#wearyoursuperpower) for all women who believe that they are not ordinary.
It’s for the woman who is adventurous, inspirational and who is also kind enough to make
things better for someone else. It’s for the Bold and the courageous kind who has what it
takes to be a superheroine We spoke to some designers from Fashionmarket.lk on expressing
their identity with style. Designer Sajeewani Mendes Seneviratne whose label SPUNK n’
ROSES recently launched her Festive Night collection explains that it’s very important to
look at the kind of lifestyle when figuring out your fashion personality. It tells a story
of who you are. What you wear, how you carry yourself in the workplace and your social
events is the story that people read about you. Whether you are a person who appreciates
heritage crafts, bold prints, minimal tailoring, this is your story and what you wear
should inspire other people. The most important step is to first define your style. Once
you have crossed this hurdle then you can shop for clothes knowing what you will feel most
comfortable in and what truly suits your personality. Image, identity and clarity are the
keywords that will help you in this process. Your image is what you put out there, your
identity is who you are inside and when image and identity are in sync there is clarity in
how you present the real you. Designer Ann Mendis who launched her Eclectic Traveller
Collection is of the view that when it comes to experimenting with new fashion trends you
need to ask yourself, “will this be an extension of my persona that others would feel is
me –and endorse? Additionally , you need to be bold and willing to take charge of your
extension of creativity and be willing to stand firmly behind it. And beyond that , I
would question the wearability, the comfort factor and how each individual outfit would
complement you and how it would impact your personality."" Designer Ann Marie advises
people on this score by saying “Just be yourself and follow your own style” You also need
to find the right balance between your personality and the latest fashion trends. Although
there are a wide variety of styles in the market, it is important that you find one that
highlights your personality and complements your body shape too. Far too often people tend
to go with a trend without considering the all-important question of “does it suit me?”
Imparting her opinion on what people should do to avoid committing a fashion faux pas,
Sajeewani states “simply avoid wearing anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Be
conscious of what will really look great with your shape, colour, experience and occasion.
Be tasteful and discipline yourself to avoid selecting anything that makes you look
awkward. Whatever that you chose to wear must wear with confidence.” The key to
identifying your fashion superpower to is to experiment and be honest with yourself. If
you are not comfortable wearing it then do not buy it. After all your clothes have to be
an extension of your personality and not the other way around. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is

life_fashion90_2_6_Ways_To_Join_The_Sustainable_Fashion_Movement.pdf,"6 Ways To Join The Sustainable Fashion Movement
Jun 03 2019. Ever wondered what happens to the clothes you throw into the trash? Well,
here is a fun fact; they decompose together with the rest of the garbage, and this process
of decomposition releases toxic greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Yes, our
clothes and the apparel industry in general contributes vastly to global warming which is
now very quickly causing damage to our environment and consequently to our lives.
According to the United Nations Climate Change Chapter, the fashion industry contributes
10%of the greenhouse gases due to its rigorous usage of raw materials, transportation and
extensive energy consuming production lines. This consumption of energy is higher than
both the shipping and aviation fraternities put together, this was a shocking revelation
to me, I am sure you are baffled too. So, here’s the deal; the need of the hour is to
switch to sustainable fashion or at least try to minimize the amount of fashion waste that
leads to climate change. Since the production of clothes is not going to stop and nor is
our fetish with the latest trends that come out this summer; lets join the sustainable
fashion movement and find smarter ways to reuse, repurpose, and recycle from the comfort
of our homes. Host a Garage Sale If you’ve got into the mood of spring cleaning this
summer and want to know what you can do with all the excess clothes that have made it out
of your closet, then hosting a garage sale is the right thing to do. Colombo is catching
up to the idea of garage sales and it’s your time to join the bandwagon if you want get
rid of the clothes you don’t need and also make a small profit while doing it. Add in
other items like good reusable furniture that you want to replace this Avurudu season with
brand new editions and your garage sale will definitely see some takers. Calling your
relatives and ‘aunties’ who you know will also be de- cluttering their homes, will be a
splendid idea and add variety to your garage sale. Who knows this could be a pre avurudu
tradition, and you will be happy to see your clothes finding new homes. DIY Into Something
New and Useful I am a sucker for DIY videos and tutorials on YouTube and channels like
Nifty. They literally teach you how to breathe in new life into everyday objects. Quiet
often than not you are in awe at the way they turn old run down stationary, household
objects, furniture and even CLOTHES to brand new pieces. Your clothes too can be turned
into something new and useful by simply making a few changes to them and your mom will be
super proud of you, Trust me!!. Turn your old t-shirts into a cute patchwork quilt. Cut
out old bath towels to use them in the kitchen to hold hot utensils or for cleaning
purposes. If you are not yet ready to part with your favorite denim skirt you can always
add a little lace to it and turn it into a fancy piece of evening wear. Join a Clothes
Swap Event Have you ever attended a book swap? Well, a clothes swap is just the same
except you switch clothes instead of books. This is a great way to meet up with friends
and family over some ice coffee, have a good time and walk away with new clothes for free!
Weather you’ve been eyeing a particular denim jacket your friend has owned for some time
or the quintessential saree your cousin has worn at weddings and doesn’t wear any more
then, clothes swaps are the thing for you. Basically, you have a fun time catching up with
your friends and family and walk away with new pieces to your wardrobe. Rent Out Your
Clothes Ever wondered what to do with your wedding dresses, sarees, and heavily worked
lahengas? If you’ve used your wedding attire to its maximum and it’s just hanging
aimlessly in your wardrobe without a purpose, a good way to reuse it, is to rent it out.
There are many people out there that have good use for them. Rich and heavy worked dresses
and sarees often get rented as costumes that tenants are willing to pay for. Donate: Help
the Needy One of the most common and paramount ways of extending the lives of your clothes
is to donate them to charities and the needy folk in your communities. Charities, Welfare
Organizations, local community centers and several Non-Governmental Organizations are
always on the lookout for people who donate clothes that can be given to the needy andhomeless. Avurudu is just around the corner and Ramadan is on its way too, so if you want
to do some good then this is the best way. Get in touch with a community or welfare
organization near you or reach out to the needy in your neighborhood and give new life to
your clothes, they will serve a better purpose than rotting in landfill sites. Resell to a
Retailer or Sell at Flea Markets Do you find yourself stuck with a blouse or a t-shirt
that seemed perfect when you bought them, but when you later wear them, they seem a bit
off? Trust me it’s a very common occurrence, we end up chucking away items like clothes,
scarves, accessories, shoes, and bags with their price tags in our closet only to use them
later or to find the right occasion to wear them at, which sadly never happens. Thus, we
are left with a surplus of things that have never been used. A better way to repurpose
them is to sell them to a retailer near you and make few extra rupees. It’s a smart way to
get rid of clothes you don’t need and make money instead. There are a lot of shopping
festivals and flea markets happening around Colombo this season. If you have brand new
clothes and accessories that you would rather sell, instead of throwing them or giving
them away, then try renting a stall at the upcoming flea markets. By – Shamim Imtiaz Your

life_fashion90_2_Asanga_Godamuna_-_The_Allure_of_Spices.pdf,"Asanga Godamuna - The Allure of Spices
Nov 05 2018. Asanga Godamuna was born on the 22nd of January 1979 with his schooling done
in Royal College. He completed his higher studies with a degree in Bachelor of Design
(Hons), faculty of Architecture in University of Moratuwa. Asanga is married to Mrs.
Ruwandika Senanayake (Senior Lecturer, Department of Integrated Design, University of
Moratuwa) having a four-year-old son. FASHION EXPERIENCES Motive behind the exhibition and
pop up sale? The motive behind my exhibition and pop up sale is to introduce my collection
to the customers and provide them with an alternate solution to traditional fashion shows.
What is your main inspiration and how does it apply with your work? The main inspiration
for my collection is the “SPICES”. My collection is based on sarees, thus, the challenge
in designing the 6-yard fabrics applied with colours and textures through a proportion
with a weave of experiment is how my work applies with the inspiration. How well do you
work with other designers? Well, I know most of the “contemporary designers” in the
fashion field right now. However, so far I haven't done any collaborative work with them,
but I do have a mutual respect and appreciation towards their work. Provide an example of
a time when you successfully achieved an organized task with a group of people. I am a
designer who works with “weavers to create handloom fabrics. I think is that my whole
design process is an organized task done with a group of people, who are actually
interested in taking up my project as their own in creating the handwoven sari or garment
made out of the fabrics is what I consider to be a successful task or a group achievement.
An example that I would like to cite is the “Allure of Spices” exhibition held on the 27th
of October 2018. This was a successful collaboration of Design, Production, Marketing and
Selling which showcased the group involvement through every segment. I give special thanks
to my model Methma Jayawardhana and “Rithihi” for supporting in my retailing process. Give
me a description of when you thought outside the box? How did it help with your collection
“Looking at usual things through an unusual eyes"" inspired me to look in to spices which
later materialized in to new design elements of my collection. Tell me how you organize
plan and priorities for your work? Even though it doesn't work exactly as planned, I
always plan my schedules a week ahead with my priority of managing my health and family
duties along with work. Are you a detail oriented person? I prefer to settle for
satisfactory solutions rather than perusing an optimal solution, which in a way ensures I
can look at the big picture and decide what to detail and what not to detail. Describe
your brand/ line of product Well talking about my brand/line I own a label by the name
“ASANGA” mainly focusing on handwoven sarees. Description of your personal style SIMPLE
CLASSIC AND CASUAL, but it does vary with the occasion. How long have you been a
professional designer? What is your earliest design memory? Now it’s almost been 13 years
as a professional designer and from that the most memorable design memory is my first
participation at Colombo Fashion Week in 2008. What are you fascinated by at the moment
and how does it feed into your work? The things that currently fascinate me the most are
sacred geometry, ancient cultures and mythology and anything that is mysterious about
life, nature and Hhstory. Designer Tip: Nothing comes easy. So work smart and keep going.

life_fashion90_2_Buzz_with_Danu_-_20_years_and_counting_CFW.pdf,"Buzz with Danu - 20 years and counting... CFW
Mar 15 2023. A journey that started in 2003 completes an important milestone two decades
later. From a handful of designers with little aspiration for the younger generation to
pursue fashion as a career, to an eco-system that promotes sustainable fashion and design,
it's been a journey of interesting ups and downs. From pre-war to post, there were
opportunities that created pathways for young Sri Lankan designers to follow. Today more
than 80% of designers we see are the product of the CFW design development platform. Today
I speak to the main man Ajai Vir Singh, Managing Director CFW Holdings, who has also
changed for the better from a man of few words Ajai to a warmer, friendlier Ajai who is so
relaxed during a show, even if don’t go the way it’s planned :) 20 years! When you took
this on back in 2003 did it look like you will get here? Not really. I didn’t imagine
that. It took me a couple of years to think about starting and giving it a try. After the
first edition, it was quite a challenging 4-5 years. Till the first new designer(s)
emerged on the scene. That gave me hope. At that time there was hardly a fashion
infrastructure. There was also not much of an aspiration or something to look forward to
for younger ones to come into fashion or creative fields. What’s the biggest thing you
have learned as a person championing this brand CFW? That my mindset is my external
environment. I have learnt a few others, Stay Hungry, and Strive for Excellence. When you
are trying something new you will find yourself alone. But you are placed there for a
purpose. CFW serves and leads the fashion industry in Sri Lanka. What would you say has
been the most powerful moment in the past 20 years? There are a few, but the first one was
somewhere in 2009 when I noticed there was an emergence of Pride in Sri Lankan fashion
when people started wearing, buying and discussing Sri Lankan fashion at social
gatherings. To me, that was powerful to revive the industry and engage the younger
generation. And then years later when I realised that close to 85% of designers that we
see today are the result (groomed, mentored or presented) of the CFW platform. It has had
a considerable impact on the industry. Do you feel there is space for more shows like CFW
to come into the market? Yes, there is always a place for a unique idea. In the past 20
years, you have created multiple personalities. What would you tell the new lineup of
designers who are waiting to make it? I would encourage younger ones to pursue an interest
in design, any form of design, as I personally believe design entrepreneurship is very
important for any country, as it develops soft power, it gives identity, increases
cultural depth, reverses brain drain and there is a tremendous opportunity for it in Sri
Lanka. Fashion is growing and we are actively promoting sustainable fashion which is in
demand. The creative release is a great positive energy that nurtures it. Describe 20
years in one word? In this edition, there will be 30 Sri Lankan and international
designers showcasing, such as Darshi Keerthisena of Buddhi Bartkisk, Charini Suriyage,
Dimuthu Sahabandu, Sonali Dharmawardena, Amilani Perera, Fouzul Hameed, Indi Yapa
Abeywardena, Asanka De Mel and many others. The Show dates begin from the 29th of March to
the 2nd of April 2023. Let the fashion madness begin. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a
Marketing qualification (only because he needed to study, and not because he wanted it).
He has been a part of the team for seven years and is the face behind Buzz with Danu, and

Jan 09 2018. Taking the advice of her friend who told her to start selling the clothes she
used to make for herself turned out to be the best decision ever, as that propelled
designer Thilini to a career in fashion. The proud owner of a label called All About IV,
Thilini has just launched her latest collection called All Checked Out which is a
Christmas inspired tropical collection. What made you embark on a career in fashion? I’ve
always enjoyed making my own clothes but never thought anyone else would be interested in
what I made. One day, a friend suggested I should just try it out and I thought I’d make
30 pieces and test the market out. It sold out in a couple of days and now I’m here! Name
of label ? All About IV What is your latest collection called? All Checked Out Describe
this new collection? It’s a Christmas/winter-inspired tropical collection with different
varieties of plaid and check patterns What inspired this collection? I love plaid but find
that it’s always hard to wear in Sri-Lanka as it’s too warm for the weather. I wanted to
make some outfits that are versatile in our tropical climate. They are all free-flowing
and can either be dressed down or up. What are the challenging aspects of running a
fashion business in Sri Lanka? The limited supply of home-grown fabrics. Where do you
retail your stuff? The Design Collective and Zudhora What is your top fashion tip? Always
add an element of surprise – it could be an accessory or statement shoes. A touch of
contrast makes a good outfit great! Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? The Design
Collective Who is your muse? My sister, Mel. Fashion prediction for next season? A fun
twist to 90’s clothing, sport-luxe and fringes. What is fashion no- no ? Logo-palooza -
wearing designer logos from head-to-toe. Who would you like seeing dressed in your
creations? Rachel Zoe, Nicole Richie Which designers/brands are you influenced by?
Camilla, Roberto Cavalli What’s the best way to accessorise your clothes? A solid belt and
black open-toe heels would be plenty for this collection. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

gracefulness are the key elements she incorporates into her latest collection. What made
you embark on a career in fashion? Since the time I was little I have always been inspired

Describe this new collection? This collection of garments is inspired by asian and western
cultural influences pertaining to femininity and gracefulness of a woman. The collection
has practical and wearable clothing incorporating prints, embroidery and lace created by
local artisans. How long have you been a designer for ? I think I have always been a
designer since I was a little girl, but as a professional designer it has been about 5
years now. What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri lanka?
You have to be careful about the cultural sensitivities of the people. There are certain
things you can do in the west, but not in Sri Lanka. So it is a fine balancing act. Where
do you retail your stuff? HOUSE OF SHAAKYA 46,Stratford Avenue,Colombo 06 What is your
top fashion tip? Be original and nurture you fashion flair by paying attention to detail,
this makes a woman feel confident. Fashion prediction for next season? The next collection

life_fashion90_2_Designer_1-2-1_Christina_Peiris.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Christina Peiris
Feb 16 2021. The livewire behind the brand X.TINA is Christina Peiris, who was crowned
Miss Universe Sri Lanka 2017. Driven by her love for fashion Christina launched X.TINA in
Abu Dhabi in 2017 and sold her merchandise mainly in Abu Dhabi and Dubai. For Christina,
it made sense to launch her brand in Sri Lanka which she did a few years back but in 2020
re-launched her brand with a fresh look. Her styles are youthful and stylish and cater
well to a younger fashion-forward audience. WHAT SPARKED YOUR INTEREST IN FASHION DESIGN ?
From a very young age, I used to love playing around with leftover fabrics and creating
new dresses for my dolls. I used to be inspired by the cartoons I watched to the books I
read. I was always into art and the creative side of things. I would draw every single day
when I was in school or after school. My grandmother used to dress us up when we were
younger in all sorts of clothes and styling. WHAT MADE YOU TAKE FASHION MORE SERIOUSLY AND
MAKE A CAREER OUT OF IT? When I graduated from high school in Abu Dhabi I immediately
started my degree in Fashion Design when I was 17 years old. Soon after I graduated, I
moved back to Abu Dhabi to join the corporate world and after a year passed by I realised
that that was not the life I had envisioned. I loved being in control of my own work and
being my own boss. I then moved back to Sri Lanka to do my research. Finding the right
manufacturers to work with was the biggest struggle I faced as a designer. I soon began to
venture into the world of batik as it was something I took up in college as well. Batik
was rare and new to the Middle Eastern market as I mainly sold my designs there in the
beginning. HOW HAS YOUR WORK EVOLVED SINCE YOU BEGAN YOUR OWN LABEL? Since Covid-19 I was
able to re-launch in October 2020 and the brand has picked up again immensely. I am
currently designing basics and day to day wear that fits the everyday Sri Lankan customer.
X.TINA will be launching a designer batik collection in April and I am so excited to open
the doors to our designer wear clients again. Many of our customers are mostly returning
customers so we have also built a community as a brand and are able to form relationships
with one another. ARE THERE ANY TYPES OF CLOTHING THAT YOU AVOID DESIGNING? I avoid
designing bridals or evening wear similar to that category as it does not tie in with the
brand image. I also avoid designing clothes that are uncomfortable. I want customers to
feel empowered, confident, sexy and beautiful while still being able to wear one of our
designs. I avoid designing garments that are not practical or that have exaggerated
ruffles, frills, sleeves etc. The silhouettes remain clean and timeless. WHERE DO YOU LOOK
FOR CREATIVE INSPIRATION? Most of my creative inspiration stems from the question “what
would I like to wear?” Based on this single question I am able to design an entire capsule
collection for my brand. I do a lot of research on what’s available in Sri Lanka, what has
been done, what hasn’t been done and what people want and need that they cannot find
locally. When I constantly question myself it inspires me to design better. Creative
inspiration definitely sparks from questioning myself as a designer and customer. I am
also up to date with the new trends and colours that are in season as I am constantly
online gaining information. WHO IS YOUR MUSE? My mother is my muse. She was the one who
encouraged me to design every day. When I lost her to cancer 12 years ago it was an
extremely devastating time but I still managed to keep my focus and remembered the times
she encouraged me to pursue fashion designing. It’s because of her that I decided to add a
humanitarian element to my brand and donate a percentage to the cancer hospital. WHAT ARE
YOUR SUSTAINABILITY CREDENTIALS? X.TINA is a cruelty-free brand and a per cent of our
profits are donated to the cancer hospital every December before Christmas. When I
launched a brand I knew I wanted to do something more out of it. I didn’t want to simply
design clothes and sell them. I wanted to be able to contribute to those in need in some
way or the other. WHAT ARE YOU FASCINATED BY AT THE MOMENT AND HOW DOES IT FEED INTO YOUR
WORK? I am currently working on designing pieces that I love but unable to wear. Forexample, I love a good backless top but at the same time, I don’t feel comfortable going
out without a bra. I am sure there are many out there similar to me. So for my next
collection, I have designed a backless top that can be still worn with a bra! WHAT IS THE
BIGGEST LESSON THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED SINCE YOU STARTED YOUR COMPANY? To work with your
brain and not your heart. In the industry, it is very frequent to be pushed around and to
be taken advantage of. Especially when it comes to working with manufacturers and buying
fabrics. Many want to take the easy way out and your heart is what will allow them to and
it did happen for many years. Now that I am able to stay focused and be firm with those
around me I am able to get everything done exactly how I want it to be so that my
customers are content at the end of the day. WHAT ROLE DO YOU THINK SOCIAL MEDIA PLAYS IN
FASHION TODAY? Social media and being able to connect with each other brings diversity and
innovation to our community. Instagram plays a big part in both my businesses. I am able
to link products from my website to Instagram so that customers may simply tap on a photo
to find out the price and details of a product. This also lets people engage with brands
and trends that are happening around us. Many brands are able to sell via Facebook or
Instagram and it does not even require a functioning website, which I think is great for
startups especially. There is a lot of engagement which also brings publicity to the brand
on social media. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_2_Designer_1-2-1_Nelun_Harasgama.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Nelun Harasgama
Jan 26 2021. The designer and founder of Ohe Island is the charming but self-effacing
Nelun Harasgama. She creates sarees which can only be described as masterpieces of
delicate art. Working mainly with silks, handwoven fabrics, lace and pure cotton, Nelun
uses batik and patchwork to create bespoke pieces which are works of art. Nelum launched
Ohe island in 2010 and since then her brand has grown in popularity with many keen to own
unique one-off pieces she creates. What sparked your interest in fashion design? I love
traditional crafts and design principles and using contemporary aesthetics. So clothing
followed from that. What made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it.
Lots of ideas came into my head and that’s how style became a career. Are you self taught
or did you study fashion design? I studied Visual Communication and Fine Art at
university. I guess fashion is a type of communicating visually. How has your work evolved
since you began your own label? Oh dear, I don’t think it has. I just have these images in
my head and keep turning them into items of fashion. Are there any types of clothing that
you avoid designing? It’s not that I avoid designing some sorts of clothing, it’s just
that all the Ohé work uses handmade lace, handwoven fabric and pure cotton or silks and
that makes it difficult to do fast fashion. Where do you look for creative inspiration?
Inspiration is awareness, I feel. So it can come from old masters to the industrial
revolution to a walk in the jungle. Who is your muse? Friends, the people down my lane,
Maria Callas, it’s endless. What are your sustainability credentials? Ohé uses small
sustainable production to make things. We use every bit of fabric and have no time
constraints. Everything is made at our home or in a craftsperson’s home. What are you
fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? I have always been so
involved and interested in whites and textures. I am also fascinated by paintings and
their language. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your
company? Change is necessary but I am not too keen on change. What’s your motto? Go where
the day takes you. Which international or local designers are you inspired by? K. T. Brown
is the best designer ever. Sonali Dharmawardena does the most beautiful batiks. I have
loved the work of Zandra Rhodes since I was little. What is your favourite part of being a
designer? That you wake up every morning with a new design idea in your heart. How do you
want women to feel when wearing your clothes? Happy. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

Samaadhi did not study fashion she appears to have the knack of knowing how to create

for? Just over a year What inspired this collection? So many things: from the way I tie my
beach sarong, the basic silhouette of my denim dungarees to a classic slip dress. What are
the challenging aspects of running a fashion business in Sri Lanka? The market is very
small so our costs are quite high. It's very difficult to reach economies of scale in this
country. So it's always difficult to cater to everyone. For a country that is known for
their manufacturing and workmanship , it's very hard to find suppliers that have low
minimums and are willing to work with local/smaller businesses Where do you retail your
stuff? I retail at PR in Sri Lanka and also take part in pop-ups in New York What is your
top fashion tip? Less is more Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? PR and a lovely new
shop called Aarya Who is your muse? My best friends and other strong women I surround
myself on a daily basis, I've named all of my pieces after them Fashion prediction for
next season? Oversized pieces which are belted at the hips What is fashion no-no ?
Shoelace chokers Who would you like seeing dressed in your creations? Kate Moss, Solange
and Tracee Ross Which designers/brands are you influenced by? Calvin Klein in the 90s,
Celine, Jil Sander What’s the best way to accessorise your clothes? Confidence!!! Own it
and you won't need anything to make your clothes stand out. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

life_fashion90_2_OLU_SWIM_WEEK_DESIGNER_INSIGHTS__2021.pdf,"OLU SWIM WEEK DESIGNER INSIGHTS 2021
Nov 13 2021. Colombo will come alive as CFW presents Olu Swim Week during two nights of
back to back fashion on the 12th and 13th of November. Colombo's fashion pack is chomping
at the bit, eagerly awaiting the shows after a hiatus of fashion events. This edition of
Olu Swim Week focuses on Luxury Resortwear with emphasis on the festive season and
destination weddings. The current ‘New Normal’ presents an interesting scenario for
fashion designers, where aspects of sustainability play an important role alongside
providing the design solution a fashion consumer expects. The Ballroom at Shangri La and
the Port City are the two chosen venues to provide a stunning backdrop as a crop of
leading fashion designers take to the runway to showcase their collections. Following the
theme of circularity in fashion this season too the designers have been challenged with a
brief that places emphasis on creating a collection that focuses on sustainability and
repurposing garments to ensure minimum waste. Founder and President of Colombo Fashion
Week AJAI VIR SINGH whose brainchild of fashion week has revolutionised the fashion
industry since its inception 18 years ago has striven diligently to position Sri Lanka as
the fashion hub of South Asia. Speaking on the challenges posed by the new normal in
staging an event of this magnitude Ajai said “It’s our 18th year and while every year
there are challenges to maintain quality and standards, this year’s show has brought about
new challenges as the supply system to create fashion weeks have weakened due to business
pressures. And people are mentally in lockdown mode which needs to open up. This also
includes designers creative mindsets. Sponsors under business pressures. Hence it’s a
challenge of a world trying to come out of lockdown with its own interpretations. Yes, the
environment brings its own challenges. It’s not been easy.” This year the show includes an
element of bridal wear. Explaining the rationale behind the inclusion Ajai says ""2021 has
been a year of ‘New Normal’, interesting challenges and opportunities. Fashion as an
industry while in need of change has also been struggling. Lockdowns took its toll. Hence
we decided to create a specially curated CFW edition, Luxury Resortwear (as tourism will
open), destination weddings (weddings were postponed) and the upcoming season where people
will be eager to go out. The focus of CFW was to create opportunities for designers,
create a sense of optimism and positivity for the society in a thoroughly responsible
manner following all Covid Protocols. Hence keeping the above in mind a bit of bridal was
part of the plan"" Introducing the theme of circularity in fashion a year or so ago Ajai
has been steering the participating designers to adhere to the principles of circularity.
CHARINI SURIYAGE is one of Sri Lanka's leading designers and a regular at fashion week.
The versatile designer who favours loose-fitting silhouettes in her signature style of
photo prints looks forward to the show as ""Resort wear is what suits Sri Lankans and it
should embrace as islanders. It’s a continuous summer for us Sri Lankans and we need
clothing that suits the climate and the island vibe to celebrate living on an island.
Another perspective to this is because Sri Lanka has an immense potential of being a great
tourist destination which opens doors to a thriving fashion business if we sell the right
clothes to go with the resort lifestyle. On meeting the challenge of adhering to the
principles of circularity Chiarini adds “I have been a person who has been interested in
sustainability, therefore the brand has inherited the same eco-consciousness. The
challenge has been the consumer's readiness to embrace and in some instances except
circularity as an important point to consider when purchasing.” A newcomer to Olu Swim
Week is Galle based designer duo TIVON and SEEMA, the founders of Karma Collection.
""Although we are an established brand of 4 years, this is our debut at CFW. Our collection
promises to be full of colour, vibrant and eye-catching. “We have taken our inspiration
from two incredibly strong female icons, Frida Khalo and Iris Afrel and created a
collection that any woman or man wearing would feel powerful, strong and confident.” Thelivewire behind men's fashion in Sri Lanka and a designer who also focuses on humanitarian
work designer FOUZUL HAMEED values the business potential of showing at Olu Swim Week. He
says “Shows such as this will improve and motivate designers to upgrade. While Sri Lanka
is a manufacturing hub it adds value to the garment industry. The garment industry used to
be one of the top 5 industries that brought in revenue to the country. A show of this
nature can bring awareness to the garment industry. Being a tropical country and placed in
a prime location geographically. We can be the fashion hub of resort wear for the world .”
ASLAM HUSSEIN another front runner in Sri Lankan fashion circle is long considered a
designer who favours structured tailoring. He is famed for his bridals therefore it would
be interesting to see what he presents in terms of bridals for destination weddings. Aslam
says “I want to wow the audience with my collection. I love structured design which I have
incorporated in a more relaxed manner while not compromising my signature style. To
minimise waste I have repurposed clothes from previous collections to give it a fresh look
in a completely different silhouette. This has been one of the most challenging
collections I have created”. Designer DIVYA JAYAWICKRAME who wowed the audience when she
first presented her maiden collection at the emerging designer showcase a while back
brings to the show a collection inspired by Sri Lankan beaches. “Everyone has been stuck
at home for months. We need to go out and relax but there is still a “stay at home”
warning. Sri Lanka is surrounded by sea. “My secret beach” suggests finding beautiful
beaches and considering travelling alone... Using my signature block printing method I
have developed my collection to bring it into a luxurious fashion collection.” Another
designer whose work is much admired and eagerly anticipated is DARSHI KEERTHISENA.
Credited with creating a renaissance in batik for younger audiences her striking designs
in various hues are visually arresting. This time Darshi has been inspired by K Pop. ""Our
collection is inspired by many things. multi-wear- convertible garments with the ability
to wear them and style them differently to give them more than one look. I have heard many
times that some people today don’t want to wear or to be photographed in the same outfit.
We want to give them options to restyle the outfits and also with a message it’s cooler to
help the planet by investing in well-made clothes that lasts. Some pieces are reversible
and multi-way with multi-way styling. Less is More! During the pandemic I began watching
Korean dramas and listening to K-pop. Some of the silhouettes are inspired by their
historical outfits combining with comfortable resort silhouettes."" Providing the hair and
makeup looks for the Show is RAMANI FERNANDO who has been associated with CFW since its
inception. Ramani and her talented team put in long hours behind the scenes to execute
sharp fashion looks which complement the collections. Speaking on what's in store for the
show Ramani says “This year CFW resort makeup and hair trends are on par with some of the
looks we have seen internationally. While bare-faced skin is very much on trend this
season we hope to deliver some exciting trends like bold eyes, pops of colour and neutral
lips to name a few. As for hair, we will be going with effortless chic looks that have a
lot of flow and movement as well looks where hair will be held together in a sleek
manner.” Ceo of CFW FAZEENA RAJABDEEN who plays a pivotal role in pulling the show
together says “We have a great line up of designers from Charini and Darshi to Aslam and
FH. The newcomers Divya and Karma Collection are all set to present some great collections
which have kept to the brief we issued them with. Our commitment to circularity in fashion
is unwavering and we have encouraged all the designers to follow those principles
diligently. We look forward to presenting two days of thought-provoking and exciting
fashion.” Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_2_The_Sari_Blouse.pdf,"The Sari Blouse
May 15 2017. Up till recently the sari was the main feature with the blouse only playing a
supporting act. But the once humble blouse, is being thrust into the spotlight by many
Indian designers, and this was most evident on a recent trip to Mumbai post Lakme Fashion
Week. It’s interesting to see how the blouse is turning into the protagonist and the sari,
easy on embellishment, is taking on a sedate form. As most trends in the sari world stem
from India, it’s interesting to see what designers there are looking to for inspiration.
Designers seem to be focusing on a new market, one that brands in every field are trying
to speak to and understand, the millenials, the whimsical, unpredictable millennial, a key
consumer with an escalating buying power. The young market is also perceiving fashion
beyond its materialistic quality, and embracing it in a cerebral and emotional way as a
lifestyle. Contemporary fashion has smoothened its rigid structure and ushered in an era
of acceptance and inclusiveness. We’re also looking at a generation that wears billowing
sleeves and floor grazing hemlines, where sex appeal lies more in ambiguity and less in
the obvious. There’s no stopping this fashion staple. Fashion-forward women are
incorporating this cropped style in their closets. Whether it’s Anita Dongre, Sabyasachi
or Sanjay Garg, there isn’t a single Indian designer who doesn’t love the crop! It helps
that it’s easy to pair with lehengas, saris and palazzos alike. The Peplum The peplum was
originally introduced into Western clothing as an overskirt to give the waist a cinched
look wear. It’s used to add some flair to an everyday look. We’re living in the Internet
age where popular culture is highly influential and fashion thrives on the ideal of
unconventionalism. Designers from Anita Dongre and Monisha Jaising to Shantanu & Nikhil
are incorporating flirty peplum jacket blouses and simple peplum top blouses to their
lehengas and saris for a polished update. The Athleisure and Jacket Several designers are
creating prêt saris and blouses that the wearer can simply step into. The athleisure trend
has seeped into Indian wear where we can observe athletic ribbed necklines and diaphanous
sweatshirt sleeves and the structured jacket blouse. These work well with the sari and are
an excellent workwear addition. Make it trendy with bomber jacket designers loving the
jacket blouse, and these include Anushree Reddy, Monisha Jaising, Rahul Mishra and Payal
Khandwala. The Bare Shoulder Recent sightings on the runway displayed the sari sans a
classic blouse. Instead it was coupled with pussy-bow shirts, and Victorian collared
cropped tops as seen at Jayanti Reddy, as well as deconstructed shirts, sheer off-shoulder
blouse, off shoulder bandeau and cold shouldered shirt blouses are also catering to a
highly conscious consumer who believes in reusability and extending the longevity of a
garment, one who wants to cultivate a personal style without spending blindly. It’s time
to add a dose of sultry appeal to your ethnic closet. Designers giving the trend a nod
include everyone from Manish Malhotra, Tarun Tahiliani and Anamika Khanna to Sabyasachi
and Payal Singhal. Androgyny - The Structured Shirt Gender fluidity is not just a buzzword
in new age fashion; it has cast a wide net in a spectrum of areas, from model castings on
international and domestic runways, to the liberation of tags amongst the youth. Designer
Payal Khandwala is no newcomer to this concept; over the past few seasons she has shown
varied interpretations of the austere man’s shirt under the sari in asymmetrical shapes
and lustrous fabrics. The shirt blouse is being increasingly favoured for the smart yet
utterly comfortable repertoire they promise. At the peak of its glamorous avatar, under
the influence of Bollywood cinema, the blouse took on an erotic form resembling modern day
corsetiere with low backs and dipping necklines. The renewed iteration is relaxed and one
that conceals the obvious erogenous zones. It’s audience are also looking at silhouettes
that are more forgiving, to create accessibility in design. ""The fact that most people do
not have a model’s form and shape, means that by necessity we are reverting to more modest
silhouettes as these are more marketable and appeal to a wider audience."" - Rta KapurChishti, author of Saris of India: Tradition and Beyond. Your comment (*)",4425

life_fashion90_30_A_Princess_Remembers.pdf,"A Princess Remembers
Nov 15 2017. Celebrated Sri Lankan fashion designer KT Brown and her team presented a
runway show which related the story of a journey of a young Rabari from girl to princess.
Drawing on the inspiration she has gleaned from her visits to Rajasthan the show contained
elements which paid homage to the people, fashion and culture of that iconic Indian City.
The prelude to each segment of the show was a traditional Rabari outfit which was then
followed by KT’s own take on it. The collection showcased a variety of fabrics, from
linen, crepe, silk, cottons , faux leather and chiffon. Using a muted colour palate KT
played it safe by sticking to blacks and blues with a few pinks and champagne hues thrown
in. We also saw a few block prints which added interest to the collection. The colourful
embellishing on the cropped jackets also helped to capture the essence of Rajasthan.The
collection was perfectly accessorized with jewellery from CJS, PR and Abdeen Jewellers.
Each segment related a story from casual wear to evening wear which bore the typical KT
hallmark of interesting silhouettes and cuts which look simple and effortless. We also saw
some interesting jodhpurs and a crumb catcher inspired black dress which looked sleek and
sophisticated. The indigo coloured collection was quite utilitarian in look and feel and
was something new from KT. A super collection which embodied KT’s free spirited design
ethos to the tee, this collection showed that KT is still upping the ante in the fashion
stakes. “Well, I have always thought that Kanchana was quite unique. She is somebody who
understands fabrics and drapes. The show was amazing. I buy her clothes because I think
she has something quite special in the way she cuts fabrics and fixes it and in the way
she makes it look incredibly stunning. I love what influences her. I am a big fan of KT.”
Jennifer “I thought it was fabulous. I think Kanchana is the best designer in Sri Lanka.
She is a master or drape. Only she would be able to bring out a vest in brass. It’s not
very easy. The varieties of her designs are amazing. It shows that she really is the
best.” Zahara “It was a fantastic show. I appreciate her and her designs so much. Her
creations are amazing. I enjoyed it very much.” Kamil “KT is completely creative. She is
one of the best designers in Sri Lanka and I am really happy that I came here today to
witness this royal affair.” Heidy “The show was very feminine. I saw a different KT Brown.
Some pieces were very ethnic while the others were very feminine and wearable. I enjoyed
the different materials that she used. I haven’t seen these before so I loved the change
she brought out today.” Ramani “I have no words to explain the show. It was amazing. I am
a big fan of Kanchana and I am wearing a top by her right now! I was expecting something
very special and she delivered it. It was a fabulous show.” Sharmila “I think it was very
interesting and creative. I loved it. I loved the metal jacket the most and I wish I could
wear it! Overall, the creative aspect was presented beautifully.” Sandra “The designs were
fabulous. This is a show that is different from all other shows. Even the ramp was very
casual. The models were extremely good. They modelled the clothes really well.” Angeline
The Maharani of Jaipur was one of the most inspirational women from the Rajasthani region.
It is great that people today are gaining inspirations from icons that were not very
popular during their time. Their beauty and essence was reflected in these designs today.”

you to initiate ‘ Capebridal ’? A: I had a dream since childhood in starting my own
business. And the close relationship with fashion is something that is within me. Love for
fashion inspired me to come up with the idea of ‘ capebridal ’ and it turned into an
opportunity for me to fill the gap in the fashion market by offering the best art of
bridal robes for the woman. There are few beautiful souls behind this ambition. It’s my
husband who made my dream into a reality and he guides me in every step of the way. My
father, mother and my sisters have given me the greatest support to climb this ladder of
success while my father-in-law too has motivated me throughout. Q: Tell us more about the
concept. A: My brand is for the woman. We design luxe outfits for any occasion. It may be
office attire, casual outfit, designer evening wear or a bridesmaid/ bridal outfit. We
support our fashionable customers stand out as unique as possible where ever they present
themselves. We also have customized designs depending on the client’s requirement. Q: How
does ‘ capebridal ’ differ from the rest of the luxe Bridal wear brands? A: Our designs
have only one piece. Each day I come up with something new and branded. I also think
quality always stands out. We use luxury materials and blend colors to bring out the best
in the market. So, luxury speaks out the quality of the final art. Q: How is the feedback
from customers? A: I think this is the best part of being a fashion designer. It’s an
absolute satisfaction watching other people wearing your art. I always get positive
feedback from my clients and their happy faces encourages me to do something new every
day. I like to be flexible and I also allocate my time to talk to clients and offer them
the best designs according to their budget. Q : What's the scope for the bridal wear
industry in Sri Lanka today? A : Scope for fashion changes every day; people like to
follow the latest trends. Sri Lanka’s bridal wear have evolved dynamically over time due
to the rise of many thriving local businesses and brands. Everyone dream of having a
glamorous wedding; every bride, bridesmaid wants to dress elegantly. We as designers
support them to make their dreams a reality. Q : You try to keep your designs as colourful
as possible. Any reason? A : I do everything to make my customers look glamorous. I love

life_fashion90_30_CFW_2019_-_Emerging_Designer_Showcase.pdf,"CFW 2019 - Emerging Designer Showcase
Feb 27 2019. The 16th edition of HSBC Colombo Fashion Week 2019 kicked off at the Hilton
Colombo this evening, with 11 emerging designers showcasing their collections. All of
these designers who are graduates from various design schools in Sri Lanka and overseas
have undergone a mentorship programme organized by CFW in preparation for the show.
Stunning colour combinations and creative silhouettes were the order of the day as these
talented clutch of designers wowed the audience. Commenting on the Emerging Designer
Showcase, Founder and President Ajai Vir Singh stated ""The emerging designer showcase ‘is
very close to our heart. Empowering, strengthening and guiding the next generation gives
us great satisfaction and is the fruit of that we saw today.” ""This segment encompasses
the future of fashion design in Sri Lankan. CFW invests time, resources and several
Mentorship programs throughout the year to collectively impact these designers , their
work and prepare them for the industry"" shared CEO and Director Fazeena Rajabdeen Nilusha
Maddumage Take a walk in the jungle with Nilusha’s collection of green, green and more
green. From olive and emerald to bottle green and moss; pops of white and grey added
contrast to this collection. As a designer, Nilusha veers from the conventional and this
collection is no exception as she has used squares of cloth to create her silhouettes.
Exposed zips were also a feature of this collection. Shimalka Bodaragama Having only just
recently launched her label Waves of Glory, Shimalka used Hakoba fabric to create most of
her designs. Adding a luxurious feel to her collection, the Hakoba fabric in blue was
complemented with contrast colours of brown and mustard. Asymmetrical hemlines on the
blouses were complemented with elaborate shoulder embellishments along with frills. Pants
and jumpsuits formed the mainstay of this collection. Marlon Rae Showcasing at the
Emerging Designer platform for the third consecutive year, Marlon has channeled his energy
to create his own fabric. Using tie and dye along with dip dyeing techniques, this
collection featured minty greens. Delectable hues of green reminiscent of mint ice cream
were used with silver fabrics in a plethora of patchwork and colour blocking combinations
to create jumpsuits, flowing dresses and high waisted pants. Manasha Silva Making her
maiden appearance as an emerging designer, Manasha whose life revolves around fashion as
an up and coming stylist has used her experience to create a new line of clothing.
Experimenting with gender fluid clothing, this collection had oversized silhouettes in
asymmetrical cuts. She has used a mix of prints of old photographs which have been
manipulated along with fabrics in colours of white, blue and grey with pops of orange.
Shehana Dayananda Presenting a collection of silhouettes varying from daringly cut shorts,
dresses, pants and sharply tailored blazers, designer Shehana has injected an adventurous
vibe into her silhouettes. Viscose, satin and crepe are her colours of choice with beige,
mauve, navy and indigo being her colour palette. Big pleated belts in suede add a
statement to her collection. Himashi Wijeweera Using beeralu lace as her focal point, the
collection presented simple yet stunning silhouettes with intricate details. Inspired by
orchestral music, the collection aimed at recreating the contrast between soft voices
among the loud orchestral music by using sculptural silhouettes with soft beeralu lace
work. A colour palette of grey, blue, green, dusty pink and ivory was used in materials of
tulle, satin and linen. Nads Ratnayake Architecture meets fashion as Nads Ratnayake
presented a collection full of structured forms. The collection focuses on pattern and
texture by using a Japanese folk embroidery method known as ‘Shashiko’ by using a
continuous running stick to create abstract geometrical patterns. A monochromatic theme
ran along her collection while the hand embroidered textures and patterns brought out the
essence of her collection. Achala LeKoh As an environmentally conscious designer, Achala’s
collection explored the ethereal beauty of the sea. This evening wear collection captured
the fragility of washed up shells in layers of delicate pleats and layers of mesh inshimmery chic silhouettes. The outfits were rooted in her love and passion towards the
celebration of mother nature in colours of white, blue, purple, red and coral. Materials
of silk, chiffon and mesh formed the mainstay of her collection with sea inspired prints,
coral textures and sea foam patterns. Ayesh Wickramaratne Drawing inspiration from the
rustic life at sea within his Pirates of the Caribbean themed collection, Ayesh presented
an all denim ensemble. Using different sustainable denim fabrics, his collection included
one-piece garments and his collection aimed to merge designer wear with different
finishing techniques like washes and different printing techniques. The creative pattern
making throughout his collection added a sophisticated touch to the outfits. Ridma
Samaranayake Ridma’s collection drew inspiration from the Sri Lankan culture and history
as it focused mainly on the traditional clothing styles and cuts of the Kandyan era. Her
pieces incorporated the traditional craft of beeralu lace patterns and the silhouettes of
the garments paid tribute to the Kandyan era with elaborate sleeves, drapes and fills. A
soft blend of linen and silk in soft pastel and neutral colours; the collection was
elegant and sophisticated yet bold and abstract at the same time. Udarika Dalugama A
strong advocate for gender equality and human rights, Udarika’s label ‘Anonymous’ is an
upcoming brand promoting collections of unisex wear. Her collection for CFW was inspired
by the inner personalities inside humans. The silhouettes were voluminous and structured
and contrast of deep and pale colours were used to bring out her overall theme. By Tina

life_fashion90_30_Fashionably_Danu__Hugs__Kisses.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu – Hugs & Kisses
Dec 17 2020. This week I’m bringing out the child in me with this collection put together
by hugs & kisses, just as the brand says it’s a warm and friendly brand perfect for the
little you, but who said only KIDS can have all the fun so I asked them when can the big
babies join in and they are all up for it. The t-shirts are good quality and breathable
making it easy for us to carry it in our weather, funky prints and many more! Today they
speak to Shezan and Nishika about what more they offer. What sparked your interest in
fashion? Shezan: I’ve always had an interest in the fashion industry having worked in the
sector for the past 12 years. I’ve watched how international brands are designed and come
to life and always envisioned starting my own brand. When I shared my idea with my wife,
she pushed me into getting this off the ground. She’s the more ‘people person’ so she
creates the brand while I create the designs. Tell me about your collection which you have
featured in this shoot? Our collections are always unique. This collection is a range of
basic, casual t-shirts with vibrant prints. Our designs inspired by Sesame Street are a
current crowd favourite. Tell me about your brand name and what did you want to leave back
as a trademark for your brand? Hugs & Kisses was conceptualised by watching kids in our
family and from among our friends and understanding just how inspiring each one of them
can be. We wanted to build a brand that focusses on comfort and confidence and those are
our secret ingredients. As a designer, how many pieces do you put out in every collection?
Do you also custom make? All our designs are unique and therefore we produce only a
limited number of pieces from each collection. However, we release collections every month
so that our mini fashionistas have a variety of options to choose from! Unfortunately,
currently, we don’t undertake custom made orders – but that’s on our list for 2021! What
are the retail outlets which carry your brand? Currently, our products can be purchased
through Daraz.lk, our website www.hugsandkisses.co and our social media platforms What
would you say is your personal style? Simple and minimalistic! And would you be catering
to the BIG boys and Girls too!? We are currently working on a couple of exciting new
projects. I’m sure the photographs will give you a quick sneak peek. The only hint we can
give everyone at this moment is that our designs will bring out the inner kid in all the
BIG Boys and Girls too… What is the process of creating and marketing your design? Your
design inspiration. Every child is unique and has his or her own story to tell. This is
our design inspiration. Each of our collections is unique and kids have been involved in
the idea and design stages so that all our clothing is by kids, for kids. Who do you
envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? Each Hugs &
Kisses piece is designed with a specific characteristic and attitude inherent in kids. We
also attempt to give kids confidence in themselves and their strengths and abilities. Our
designs denote positive messages and breathe life into the dreams and aspirations of kids
every time they wear something from our collections. Are you self taught or did you study
fashion design? Shezan: Self-taught. But being in the industry, I have had the privilege
of working with some of the biggest brands and learned from them. What’s new in the next
few months? This year has been a challenging one for us as it has been for many. But we’ve
used it to plan some exciting new projects for 2021. Our customers will have a wider
variety of products to choose from and we might have something in store for the Big Boys
and Girls too! Stay tuned to our social media platforms to find out more! What other areas
is your brand involved in? We recently launched our very own talk show, ‘The Talk with
Hugs & Kisses.’ The show provides a platform for our kids to interview some of their
favourite personalities and listen as they share some of their most loved memories. Our
brand is also about giving back. A percentage of each purchase is gifted to various
charities that we work with. We are delighted that this Christmas too we are able to bring
a smile on many kid’s faces. What’s the new collection which is to be launched? Our newcollection includes a variety of vibrant prints including a collection inspired by Sesame
Street and the much-loved emojis. Photographer – Jehan Seedin Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a

life_fashion90_30_Hanger_and_Mannequin.pdf,"Hanger and Mannequin
Feb 15 2022. Embodying the definition of feminine and sophisticated, Anneisha Fernando
started Hanger and Mannequin, an online clothing store that is designed to cater to a
niche audience comprising a minimalistic and sophisticated lifestyle. Operating on a
boutique model, Anneisha talks to us about what her brand entails and her inspiration
behind it. What inspired you to start Hanger & Mannequin? I have always been a fashion
enthusiast and it has been one of my personal goals to launch my own fashion label. Living
overseas, I also wanted to showcase batik to the international market through contemporary
clothing. How would you describe Hanger & Mannequin’s aesthetic? Our clothing is simple
yet feminine and sophisticated. Pieces that can be dressed up or down based on your mood,
hence investment pieces with a long lifespan. Do you have a background in fashion? No, my
background is in Accounting. What has been your favourite collection to produce thus far?
I have enjoyed collaborating hand smocking that is dominant in kids' clothing into adult
fashion. My previous collections with these fabric manipulation accents along with my
upcoming collection due to be launched in April 2022 have been my favourite thus far. Is
there a particular style of fashion you gravitate towards? Minimalistic and feminine. What
kind of challenges did you face while running Hanger & Mannequin? Human resource
management, as we operate in a boutique model where we customise and manufacture when
orders are placed. The lack of importance given to deadlines and accountability by staff
have been a challenge. How has Covid-19 impacted your business? Covid 19 was an unexpected
hurdle as our business was only 4 months old when the pandemic hit Sri Lanka.
Nevertheless, we have been fortunate as we are an online business where our business
operating costs are a minimum. As more and more customers were new to the concept of
online shopping at the beginning of the Pandemic in Sri Lanka, but had to rely on this
form of shopping, our customised operations which provide custom tailoring and free
alterations service were helpful in building customer confidence in the online
marketplace. What kind of a role has social media played in popularising Hanger &
Mannequin? Social media [Instagram & Facebook] has been a pivotal force in brand awareness
and we continue to use these platforms to increase our customer network. What do you wish
to convey through your clothes at Hanger & Mannequin? I believe that a woman should always
be well dressed at both casual and formal settings and building one's wardrobe with
minimalistic yet sophisticated pieces that will be relevant in the course of time is
essential. How has the response been so far? We have been very fortunate with the customer
responses thus far as they seem to enjoy the design aesthetic, fabrics, and the price
of our product line. What is next for Hanger & Mannequin? We would like to showcase an
exclusive line at a physical store in Sri Lanka as well as expand our product lines in
Australia. Text by: Tiranya Ranasinghe Pix courtesy Hanger & Mannequin Your comment (*)",3153

life_fashion90_30_Mastering_the_Art_of_Leather_Craft_Rosaria_Liyanage.pdf,"Mastering the Art of Leather Craft: Rosaria Liyanage
Dec 16 2024. At just 31, Rosaria Liyanage has carved a niche as a leather artisan,
seamlessly blending traditional Italian craftsmanship with a global perspective. With a BA
in Fashion Design from Raffles Design College and an MA in Fashion and Culture from the
University of Bologna, Rosaria’s journey has taken her from academic halls to hands-on
artistry. Her passion for sustainable leatherwork and her Sri Lankan heritage inspired her
upcoming three-day master class at AND Fashion School in Negombo. Here, Rosaria shares her
journey, craft, and aspirations. Q How did you learn the art of leather crafting? Was it a
family tradition or formal training? I don’t come from a family of artisans, but my
journey began with a deep interest in fashion and culture, which I pursued at the
University of Bologna in Italy. During my studies, I specialized in leather craftsmanship
as part of my formal internship at Double Trouble a fashion boutique in Bologna, where I
learned both the artistic and technical sides of the craft. Q Can you describe the process
of creating a leather piece from start to finish? It starts with an idea—usually a sketch
inspired by something I’ve seen or felt. Then, I select high-quality leather and hand-cut
it based on the design. Depending on the piece, I might stitch, emboss, or dye it, adding
intricate details. Finally, I finish the piece with polishing or protective treatments to
enhance its longevity. Q What inspired you to bring your leatherworking skills to Sri
Lanka through this master class? As someone who grew up in Italy but has Sri Lankan roots,
I’ve always wanted to give back to my home country. Leather craftsmanship is a significant
part of Italian culture, and I believe sharing these skills can empower Sri Lankan
artisans to create unique products and explore global markets. Q What specific techniques
or skills do you plan to teach during the workshop? I plan to teach foundational skills
like hand-stitching, edge finishing, and the art of embossing, along with advanced
techniques like vegetable tanning and crafting high-end leather accessories. I’ll also
focus on blending traditional craftsmanship with modern design sensibilities. Q Will the
master class include a focus on sustainable leatherworking practices? Absolutely.
Sustainability is a priority for me. I’ll teach methods like vegetable tanning and share
tips on minimizing waste by repurposing scraps into smaller items like wallets or
accessories. This aligns with both global trends and environmentally conscious values. Q
What excites you most about conducting this master class in Sri Lanka? It’s the
opportunity to connect with my roots and contribute to a growing artisan community. Sri
Lanka is rich in creativity, and I’m excited to see how participants will use what they
learn to express their unique artistic voices. Q What advice would you give to Sri Lankan
artisans who want to make a mark in the global leather industry? Focus on quality and
authenticity. Tell a story through your work that reflects your heritage while meeting
international standards. Don’t be afraid to experiment and innovate, and always prioritize
sustainability—it’s what the world values today. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_30_Oh_Colombo_Kamil_Makes_a_Bold_Decision.pdf,"Oh Colombo: Kamil Makes a Bold Decision
Mar 02 2023. Having a great passion is of no point unless you decide to act on it, which
is exactly what Kamil Hewavitharana did when he switched to fashion. Fashion had always
been his passion though he did not pursue it until recently. He had been happy in his
comfort zone working for an establishment related to retail clothing. After showcasing in
many fashion shows locally and internationally at Expo Dubai, Dubai Fashion Week, GICW in
Delhi, CFW x Luxor Show, Pune and Shades of Ceylon, London, Kamil decided to step out of
his comfort zone and go out on his own and began designing for his clientele. He has
ventured into creating bridal ensembles too. The transition had not been easy at the
start. Eventually having built a client base in Sri Lanka and overseas, Kamil is now happy
that he took the bold step. Kamil has immense talent and I am happy that he is now working
on what his true passion is. When I recently met Kamil I asked him a few questions to
which he gave me short and swift answers. Q Why did you get into your previous field? I
always had a passion for clothes and when I got the opportunity to work at Romafour as
their Merchandiser and Sales Manager, I found that it was tailor-made for what I had in
mind. Q Was it a hard decision for you to choose to pursue a new career? Not really, as
this was my eventual plan. Q What skills from your previous work do you feel convert the
most to this career change? I have travelled a lot to different countries for
merchandising and through this, I learnt a lot about what was happening in the fashion
world and where to find fabric etc. I also learned to understand the needs of customers
and how to keep them satisfied. Q How have you prepared for the challenges of restarting
your career in this chosen field? My mother was the biggest influence on my decision to
move forward in this field. For as long as I can remember, although she was a teacher, she
would be at the sewing machine creating beautiful dresses for my five sisters and the
girls from the neighbourhood when time permitted it. Q Do you have any non-professional
experiences that you feel can be applied to your new career? Observing lines of fashion
daily in magazines, people roaming on the streets as well as when I travelled overseas
admiring the silhouettes of people and nature around me inspires me to develop a
kaleidoscope of colour and fashion lines. Q What do you anticipate as your biggest
challenges transitioning into this chosen field? Right now, finding good fabric and
accessories to produce all the beautiful creations we have in our minds. I wish Kamil all
the success in his quest for fashion and that very soon his label, LIMAK, will be
recognised internationally. Your comment (*)",2784

Apr 08 2019. Designer Sharmila Ruberu and her daughter Shavini have opened the doors to a
brand new fashion and lifestyle store called Ripe. Situated at 40 Flower Road, Colombo 7
the store offers a profusion of menswear and womenswear as well as kidswear and lifestyle
and wellness products. Realising a long held dream, the mother and daughter duo have
carefully curated collections by designers and young brands for the store, “We wanted to

their products. We have also kept the price points at reasonable levels ensuring that
there is something for every budget. We even have a selection of plus size clothing and a
variety of batiks too!"" said Sharmila who is best known as the designer behind the label

Colombo Fashion Week is also very hands-on in her role as co-owner of Ripe. She goes
through the collections and selects what’s best for the store keeping in mind the current
trends and what customers are looking for. “I’m really excited about the plans we have for
this store! Our main goal is to build a community of like-minded, passionate brands and
people and grow together. We have a range of items that will appeal to almost every
segment. We hope to expand further and bring together more talented individuals and brands
and help them grow as well “ The store is also environmentally conscious and does not use
any form of plastic. Ripe is a store with a laudable ideology of supporting small business

life_fashion90_30_TRENDSWIM_by_Swim_Week_Colombo_2018.pdf,"TRENDSWIM by Swim Week Colombo 2018
Jun 28 2017. TRENDSWIM by Swim Week Colombo brings together industry leaders to discuss
trends Swim Week Colombo, with its title partner Olu Tropical Water, presents another
edition of this highly anticipated segment TrendSwim, which will feature an expert forum
where thought leaders meet to discuss current trends and future directions that impact the
fashion industry. Along with this, Swim Exhibit, which showcases the latest breakthroughs
in design and technology, while highlighting the concerns discussed in TrendSwim, will run
parallel. The exhibition will feature leading brands such as Linea Aqua, Fastech Asia,
Leema Group, MAS fabrics and Thomas Kershaw, all of whom will be represented in the expert
panel of TrendSwim as well, thereby making this platform a comprehensive representation of
the industries leaders. The first discussion will be ""Global Swimwear""covering the broad
areas of Trend Direction, Consumer Behaviour and Market Direction. To take us through
these thoughts, we have selected an expert panel that comprises of leaders in the field,
which include Heidi Gosman (Co-founder of luxury swimwear brand Heidi Klein – London),
Eric Koby (CEO, luxury swimwear brand Heidi Klein – London) and Darshi Keertisena De
Livera (Creative Director - Buddhi Batiks). The panel will lead the discussion to cover
trends in style and new influences, as well as predictions on the next wave of change will
be areas touched on that will educate designers on what to expect. Various actors in the
industry will benefit from understanding what the current customer focus is and how it is
evolving in light of changing global concerns like climate change and green concerns,
ethical issues related to material sourcing and functionality of apparel over aesthetics.
The panel discussion to follow will be ""Good and Sustainable Fashion"" led by panelists
Ajai Vir Singh (Founder - Colombo Fashion Week and Swim Week Colombo; Creative Director -
Conscience), Sarinda Unamboowe (CEO/Managing Director at MAS Kreeda), David Abraham
(Creative Director - Abraham & Thakore), Shiranee Yasaratne (Advisor - Biodiversity Sri
Lanka) and Anoma Wijewardene (Artist), focusing on the latest ideas on building an earth
conscious future as well as sustainability practices and the industry perspective. The
discussion will be in line with Swim Week Colombo's new position of being ""Green
Conscious, Earth Sensitive"". With the Fashion industry being the second most polluting
industry after oil, it has become a global concern to reduce impact on the environment,
move towards 100% carbon and water neutral products and invest in the environment for the
future. The Panel will focus on these ideas as well as highlight how Sri Lanka's fashion
industry can contribute towards these efforts. The third discussion will have panelists
Yusuf Saleem (CEO at Trischel Fabrics (Pvt) Ltd) and Kireety Madiraju (Director -
Innovation, Materials & Design at MAS Holdings) enlighten us on Fabric Direction and
Technology under ""Textile Forum"". This will focus on the latest innovations in fashion and
swimwear, which will help to educate designers on the new expectation of swimwear to be
more than function as an item of clothing or be aesthetically pleasing. With growing
innovations branching out to also cover other areas, such as monitoring heart rates and
other functions performed by a pedometer, designers will be pushed to consider this as
well in their choices and design. In light of emerging health concerns, manufacturers of
swimwear are now even exploring how swim wear can even alert it's wearers of risks towards
breast cancer, heart complications or even strokes. With R&D in the apparel industry
pressing towards a more futuristic level, these ideas are becoming relevant today and
therefore require discussion. The mediator for these panel discussions will be Mihirini de
Zoysa who is a capable facilitator of such forums. The audience will consist of industry
leaders from the apparel and manufacturing sectors, students and faculty heads of fashion
institutions and media. Further to this, the panelists will also be participating in ""Swim
Exhibit"" which will take place parallel to the panel discussions and audiences will have a
chance to see these ideas discussed in actual practice. Swim Week Colombo benefits fromits collaboration with strategic partners who have understood its vision and have rendered
much support in pursuing its present goals in achieving a higher standing in the global
fashion scene, as well as its new position in being environmentally and socially more
responsible. This year's partners are Olu Tropical Water - Title Partner, Linea Aqua -
Main Partner, Hilton - Hospitality partner, Wine World - Official Lifestyle Beverage
Partner, Ramani Fernando - Official Hair and Make-Up Partner, Spa Ceylon, Leo Burnett Sri
Lanka and MSL Group Sri Lanka - Official PR Partner and Emerging Media is the Outdoor
Digital Media Partner – all of whom have extended their support towards making Swim Week
'18 a possibility and have contributed towards making this year's segment of TrendSwim a
successful dialogue. TrendSwim is a vital part of this edition of Swim Week Colombo as it
will create a platform to highlight its new position on being focussed on environmental
conservation. Furthermore, keeping with its original vision, the panel discussions will
help to improve Sri Lanka's fashion industry, raise the standard and set a bar for up and
coming designers and spread awareness of the current focus globally. For further

May 29 2017. You're My Favorite's film with Darshi Keerthisena wins CFW Fashion Film Award
The Summer Season of Colombo Fashion Week in March 2017 saw the introduction of a new
annual initiative called Fashion Films. This brought together two creative streams of
fashion and films; five talented film directors worked with fashion designers to represent
their inspiration and ideas on films shot on smartphones. The films were then entered into
a competition. You're My Favorite's (YMF's) film for Buddhi Batiks, which captured Darshi
Keerthisena's ideation won the competition. The theme of her collection was based on a
Chinese love story, the film was largely based on a poem of the designer's choice about a
love lost, and YMF used this as a base for creating the visuals for the film. YMF is a
multifaceted creative agency working in photography, film, art, production, art direction
and advertising run by sibling duo Ryan and Jonathan Wijeratne. Between the two of them
are two artists not bound by any medium, photographers, filmmakers, an avid drawer, an
actor and a chef and are now reinforced by the addition of Abhishek Gunaratnam, an
associate creative, whose previous work lists famed establishments such as MTV, VH1 and
the Rolling Stones. Speaking to Ryan on doing CFW Fashion Films he said ""Most of the time
there's so much equipment to deal with, what was fun and challenging about this project
was that all we could use was our phone. It's the first time we've shot something for work
on a phone, in a way it's easier to be creative and abstract and tell a visual story
because you don't have to worry or think about what camera to use or what lens is right
for the shot."" You're My Favorite collaborated with Darshi Keerthisena for Buddhi Batiks,
Sharmila Ruberu for Meraki, Charini Suriyage and Amilani Perera. Jason Rajasinghe
collaborated with Ajai for Conscience and Jaish Jayesinghe for 'Jai', Adhil Ghouse
collaborated with Dimuthu Sahabandu and 'U' by Upeksha Hager and John Taylor with
Catherine Rawson for The Old Railway to create the fashion films. The films were shown
before each fashion designer's segment. The directors collaborated with the designers to
capture the designer's ideas into a film. This was a new introduction to strengthen their
presentation and an interesting collaboration of two creative fields. ""Fashion has
multiple levels of expression and film is one of the most important ones, CFW is an
inclusive platform for related creative industries to collaborate and touch the creative
process with different expressions. Hence these collaborations are healthy and
constructive. I loved the work of all the film directors and they created awesome work
using a smartphone. Congratulations to all! There will be more in this space."" said Ajai
V. Singh, President and Founder of Colombo Fashion Week. This year Colombo Fashion Week
celebrated its 14th year since its inception. A journey that started in 2003 has today
revived the fashion design industry of Sri Lanka by impacting different aspects of the
fashion design industry. Ninety percent of Sri Lankan designers that we see today are
products of the CFW system. CFW throughout the year works behind the scenes on designer
development programs, fashion school programs, mentorship, retail development, fashion
marketing and craft interaction. Your comment (*)",3410
life_fashion90_31_Amilani_Perera.pdf,"Amilani Perera
Dec 10 2018. A designer who, thinks out of the box Amilani Perera is noted for her
collections which are structured with elaborate details. Not for the faint hearted,
Amilani’s clothes make a statement and it’s a bold one at that. A familiar face at CFW
Amilani has always ensured her collections add drama to the runway. What made you embark
on a career in fashion? I always wanted to be a fashion designer since I was a teenager.
When I was selecting subjects for my A/Ls, I chose art, business statistics and economics,
because I was adamant to become a fashion designer one day. It became one step closer to
my dream. After I graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore, I started my
career at MAS Holdings for the amanté lingerie brand. Thereafter I was employed as a
design consultant for Arvind Life Style Brands, Bangalore, India. While I was working at
MAS holdings I decided to launch my brand and decided to apply for Colombo Fashion week.
And once I got selected the rest was history.. These are the stepping stones that lead to
my self-titled brand AMILANI PERERA. How long have you been a designer for? Including
my time working at MAS Holdings and at Arvind Life Style Brands this will be my 10th year
been a fashion designer. What is your latest collection called? Describe this new
collection? “AMILANI PERERA is a brand for individuals and their unique lives, so when I
think about the ‘AMILANI PERERA’ Woman, I don’t envision one woman, but many. This
eveningwear collection contains many silhouettes. Such as evening dresses, sarees, pants,
rompers and even jackets where all type of women can pick and choose and style their look
from the entire range. What inspired this collection? The inspiration behind this
collection is focused on a 90's revival with a feminine edge. I wanted to take classic
silhouettes and give them a new twist for dazzling nights filled with allure and beauty.
Where do you retail your stuff? At THE DESIGN COLLECTIVE STORE ,Colombo 06 and at AMILANI
PERERA Atelier , Colombo 05 What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion business
in Sri Lanka? It’s not always easy to find excellent and reliable craftsmanship sometimes
which is extremely surprising considering the country we live in! People would rather work
at a desk job than do hand embroidery or beading on a garment; they look down upon such
work, which is rather absurd, considering that some of them are so talented. A bigger
challenge however, lies before me and that is in the form of a giant, centuries-old
misconception that fabrics like pure silk, pure leather and such are to be prized above
fabric blends. Personally, I prefer to work with vegan textiles, mainly focusing on
organic cotton, linens, Peace silk and poly blend fabrics which feel good on the skin, are
ethical and breathable and even my batiks are based on a cotton poly mixed fabric. I feel
that the global fashion industry is still rather dated in their approach to fabric
choices. We have found ways of going green and ethical in other aspects, but when it comes
to fashion, people still demand pure silk, pure leather, real fur, python skin, etc. and
most of us either don’t understand the process behind it or don’t stop to think how
animals are tortured just so that we can wear something we perceive as high fashion. The
uglier side of it is still swept under the carpet and more of us need to look beyond these
norms and promote ethical fabrics in fashion and with today’s technology, it’s not
impossible. Perceptions are changing but I feel that much more effort can be made and I
believe at some point in time, my voice and other similar voices which are speaking out
against these norms will be heard and I intend to keep doing what I can to make a change
that will benefit not only us but our environment as well. What is your top fashion tip?
Stay true to yourself in whatever you wear! It’ll show-through ! Choose the trend works
best for your personality. Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka? My favourite places
would be The Design Collective, PR, and you’ll catch me running around in Odel as well! =)
Fashion prediction for next season? Pleated knits will be a definite trend for next
season. Who would you like seeing dressed in your creations? Jessica Biel What’s the bestway to accessorise your clothes? If your dress or ensemble look is loud it’s always best
to go minimal or no accessories at all. However if your dress or ensemble look is simple
you can always play with your accessories! Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_31_Charini_Opens_Flagship_Store.pdf,"Charini Opens Flagship Store
Jul 10 2017. The eponymous label Charini opens its refined flagship store There's a
purpose to every piece designed by Charini Suriyage, one of Sri Lanka's renowned big name
designers. Inspired to create collections that are special yet accessible, this Sri Lankan
born designer – and alumnus of the University of Moratuwa and London School of Fashion -
founded her eponymous label, Charini, in 2008. The brand's fresh approach to design is one
of the reasons it's a much awaited and regular at Colombo Fashion Week. Known for her
beautiful clothes that exude elegance and casual luxury, each piece is intricately
designed and exquisitely hand-finished in Sri Lanka. Zudhora, a concept store, with two
distinct identities, the brainchild of Charini and partner designer Ramona Oshini, was her
first success in retail space. Zudhora carries a heady mix of their designs with other
standout Sri Lankan labels and is renowned for its edit of beautiful designer collections.
Charini's standalone store, at 55, Deanstone Place, Colombo 03 which opened last weekend
is the flagship store for her brand, offering a more comprehensive collection than that
featured at Zudhora. Each piece here is unique and a one off design. Combining Sri Lankan
heritage craftsmanship like batik and beeralu (pillow lace) crochet and hand weaving with
modern design, her uniquely structured handcrafted couture, ready to wear brands, bridal
and resort are all available here. The design studio at Charini also does wardrobe updates
and functional design for corporate clients. Designed for the sophisticated woman, the
collection unveiled at the store opening beautifully captured vintage imagery of Colombo
exquisitely printed on to sculptural pieces. ""It's understated but at the same time it's
very strong making you feel comfortable but also stand out in just the right way, not
shouting too loud, not saying too much with your clothing, but still making a statement.""
was the spot on observation of one of the invitees. The store aesthetic is an interesting
blend of colonial architecture and modern, understated but very cool, interiors that have
an experimental edge for her bold creatives are reinvented style classics. They allow her
to provide a slightly different type of experience for the client, with a bespoke service
and atelier on site. If you're also in need of a good coffee, juice or something heartier,
pre or post shopping then don't forget to pop into to the lovely Kafe Kolombo. This haute
haven is a great addition to the Colombo fashion landscape from Charini which is also
retailed in Europe, Australia and the USA. Your comment (*)",2664

life_fashion90_31_Designer_1-2-1_Heshanie_Ileana_Tennekoon.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Heshanie Ileana Tennekoon
Oct 28 2020. Following her motto of “your actions need to map out what you want” designer
Heshanie launched her brand Ileana in 2019 at a pop-up store in Brisbane Australia.
Favouring the style of Victoria Beckham Heshanie draws her inspiration from fabrics,
textures, architecture and the feminine form. Her brand is dedicated to celebrating
natural beauty and the female form. What sparked your interest in fashion design? When I
was 10 years old, I made a folder with my best friend with cut-outs from fashion
magazines. I can remember during exam periods, I used to finish up my paper quickly and
sketch designs on paper to put in the folder. I still have that folder. But I realised
much later in life, that it was also the women around me that inspired me and my love for
design. My sisters would always try things out with clothes, they used to cut jeans and
add little details, which was so fun to watch. My mother also had a very good eye when it
came to design and would relate stories of my grandmother sewing all my mom’s clothes. So
looking back now, there wasn’t just one thing that sparked my love for fashion design. It
was little moments that I shared with my sisters and mother and stories of my grandmother
mixed with my own experimentations with dressing up that sparked my love. What made you
take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Growing up, a career in fashion
didn’t seem that viable because not many people chose that path. I didn’t have many
designers to look up to in Sri Lanka or Australia. So I pursued a degree in Business and
IT. But my gut instinct told me to try fashion once more and give it my all, before
working for a corporate. I haven’t looked back since. I saw that I could really make a
difference by being a Sri Lankan- Australian designer and represent my two worlds. Once I
knew it was possible for me to actually have a career as a designer, I couldn’t picture
myself doing anything else. Are you self-taught or did you study fashion design? I would
say I am a bit of both. Growing up I used to hand sew a lot and think about form and
drape. I really learnt a lot of technical skills and refined my way of looking at fashion
design, after I studied fashion design. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid
designing? Every style and type of clothing has its own beauty and spirit. However, when I
design I like to focus on timeless silhouettes mixed with contemporary elements. So I
avoid using a lot of prints that will go out of fashion and fabrics that are of poor
quality. Where do you look for creative inspiration? I draw my inspiration from fabrics,
textures, architecture, feminine form and beauty in the most simple and unusual places. As
a designer, I don’t close my mind to the possibilities of design and inspirations. I look
at the world with an open mind and wait for something to move me. Describe your latest
collection? The latest collection is made in small quantities with 100% linen, sourced
from Australia. It’s made to suit the tropics with breathability as the main focus with
sleeveless designs to kaftans that you can wear in a multiple of ways. Like every
collection, the essence of it is all about functionality, comfort and timeless silhouettes
with a hint of contemporary. What are your sustainability credentials? At ILEANA, we
always keep mother nature in mind when we design and produce. We use natural and
sustainable fabrics in our collections to make our designs breathable and sustainable.
ILEANA collections are made in small quantities to reduce excess and wastage. As a
designer, I focus on creating timeless pieces that can be a part of your forever wardrobe.
What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? At the
moment, I am fascinated about volume in design and finding the balance between structure
and fluidity. I am really excited to experiment with these elements in the next collection
and see how I can find that balance between creating something dramatic and subtle. What
is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your company? The biggest
lesson I learned was to be true to yourself and your brand. You can get distracted by the
competition around and what they are doing. I had to learn how to follow my instinct andvision that I had for the brand and not compromise my core brand values. What role do you
think social media plays in fashion today? I think fashion is driven by social media. It
gives you a voice as a designer to show what you are capable of. It’s also a great way to
connect with your customers. I love hearing from our ILEANA TRIBE; whether it’s about
fabrics, colours, design or just to say Hi and learn more about the brand. It is the
greatest tool a designer has to improve their work. The feedback is so instant and you can

life_fashion90_31_Fashion_is_his_Best_Form_of_Expression_Lithira_Daluwatte.pdf,"Fashion is his Best Form of Expression: Lithira Daluwatte
Mar 15 2024. ""Style is the way to say who you are without having to speak,” said Rachel
Zoe, the well–known fashion designer. This is perhaps an apt definition of what fashion
means to Lithira Daluwatte a Fashion Designer who says that fashion is his best form of
expression. We had a chat with him about his work in the fashion industry. Q WHAT MADE YOU
BECOME INTERESTED IN FASHION AND TELL US HOW YOU BECAME A FASHION DESIGNER? From
childhood, I was very interested in fashion and I have witnessed and admired the artisanal
workshops around me. Consequently, my grandmother B. Manawadu who is a ‘ Beeralu ‘ artisan
motivated me to pursue fashion design. I vividly remember watching my grandmother for
hours on end weaving and entangling the cotton threads used in Beeralu to create awe-
inspiring designs. In the evenings I would watch my grandmother along with her peers
settle on the floor in a circle with their Beeralu beds designing intricate Beeralu laces.
Her creations developed by tangling the threads from each bobbin were breathtaking and
comprised different designs. My first proper understanding of fashion came from the late
Mangala Samaraweera’s new paper clippings and fashion collections. I am an admirer of his
work and his designs inspired me to be a fashion designer. Whilst researching I came
across Ena De Silva, Barbara Sansoni and Chandramani Thenuwara, and these individuals and
their work further inspired me. Consequently, I was able to launch a brand of my own and
work for a renowned fashion company in Sri Lanka. Q ARE THERE ANY PARTICULAR TYPES OF
FASHION THAT YOU CONCENTRATE ON? Fashion and Textile development is what I predominantly
focus on from the broad range of categories under fashion design. I constantly engage in
designing authentic and novel creations alongside native crafts communities and textile
industries. Furthermore, it is common to see a range of authentic and native textile
developments in my designs and collections whilst I am also keen on designing ‘wearable’
art pieces. Prior to designing my collections, I tend to spend numerous hours, days and
months engaging in conversation with these craftsmen and observing the artisanal process.
This is one of my favourite phases of the design process. Q WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF
FASHION? Fashion is simply my best form of expression. My designs tend to reflect the
feelings, thoughts and concepts I dwell on during said periods of time including
happiness, excitement, sorrow and anger. I tend to sketch my thoughts, experiences and
feelings in a sketchbook that I then transform into designs. I communicate stories in my
collections by including motifs, lines, hues and varying shapes. My design process is a
fusion of the stories built in my mind backed by research and ongoing issues in the world.
Q HAVE YOU DONE ANY STUDIES IN FASHION DESIGN? IF SO TELL US ABOUT IT AND HOW IT HAS
CONTRIBUTED TOWARDS THE BETTERMENT OF YOUR WORK. I pursued my studies in Fashion Design
once I completed my ALs and am currently a graduate of NIBM Limkokwing University.
Although my interest has been in design since I was a child, my university experience was
crucial in polishing my skills in design. I was able to encounter various celebrities
models and fashion experts at my university which piqued my interest in working with them.
My university lecturers offered invaluable insight in regards to Fashion Design and I must
mention Udaya Wickramasingha who provided much guidance during my college years. Q TELL US
ABOUT THE LAUNCH OF YOUR BRAND AND HOW SUCCESSFUL IT HAS BEEN. My brand is known as
LITHIRA and is a high-end designer wear brand which has been one of my childhood dreams.
LITHIRA is a vibrant and bold designer-wear brand that focuses on offering innovative,
creative, handcrafted and high-quality designs. LITHIRA caters to conscious consumers who
place emphasis on sustainability, fair trade and ethics. LITHIRA hopes to preserve the
knowledge present in the crafts community and communicate it in a new approach to the
world. Our garments are not merely products but the stories and knowledge of these
craftsmen woven into each piece. Q YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT YOU ARE AN ARTIST – TELL US
ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE. IS THERE A PARTICULAR TYPE OF ART THAT YOU CONCENTRATE ON? I havealways had an interest in art and it eventually grew and developed. I was keen on
exploring how art transitioned and transformed according to varying time periods and
cultures and how it embodied different identities in different nations. I explored various
techniques from which watercolours and portraits stood out. Q YOU MENTIONED THAT FOR YOUR
GRADUATION COLLECTION YOU ARE TRYING TO COMBINE TOURISM WITH THE LOCAL CRAFT COMMUNITY IN
THE SOUTH – HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GO ABOUT DOING THIS? A key factor of my collection was
communicating a fusion between two key concepts which are local craftsmanship and tourism.
My goal was to explore the widespread authentic craftsmanship and Sri Lankan textiles on
the south coast of Sri Lanka and to present it to an international market. Sustainability
was also a key objective of this collection and was maintained throughout the project. The
promotion of social, economic, cultural and environmental factors was vital in my
collection. The collection was solely inspired by the beautiful and awe-inspiring coast in
the south of Sri Lanka. Q FINALLY TELL US WHAT YOUR FUTURE PLANS ARE ESPECIALLY WITH
REGARD TO THE FASHION INDUSTRY, YOUR INTEREST IN ART AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT INSPIRES YOU.
So far, my projects are focused and based on researching textiles and crafts such as
knitting, crocheting and weaving. However, I am planning to expand my research into other
local crafts and textile industries in Sri Lanka. I would also expect to broaden this
research area and do experiments to explore more new textile ideas while developing my
creativity. Text Kshalini Nonis Pix courtesy - LITHIRA Your comment (*)",6005
life_fashion90_31_New_Year_New_resolutions_New_You.pdf,"New Year, New resolutions, New You
Apr 10 2017. If like me you’ve already fallen off the ‘new year, new me’ resolution
bandwagon from January, luckily the Sinhala and Tamil new year allows you a new chance and
why not turn your attention to the more “doable” remit of fashion resolutions. From
fearlessly experimenting with new trends to decluttering, everyone has some room for
sartorial improvement and here’s how to improve your fashion game in the New Year! Have no
fear! 2016 was the year in which chunky soled platforms and fishnet socks paired up,
wearing your shirt backwards signified not insanity but serious style and kitsch was uuber
cool. So, whether it’s wearing more colour or embracing patterns, maybe move out of the
black on black on black territory, break your own rules for a more diverse and exciting
look. Buy less fast fashion Think about what you’re spending your hard earned cash on, is
it too trend led, will it last, how long will I wear it for, quality over quantity! This
doesn’t mean ditching your affordable shopping habits all together, but think wisely about
those quick purchases to ensure more money and wardrobe space for more designer must-
haves. Find your outer sophistication! From tailored classics to midi skirts, fashion has
been migrating towards a more sophisticated look for a number of seasons – in part thanks
to the overwhelming popularity of Gucci’s take on granny-chic. Whether it’s trading in
your rubber slippers for kitten heels or opting for a crisp white shirt over a white
t-shirt, upgrade parts of your wardrobe to embrace your more adult self. Wear everything
you own Chances are, despite your wardrobe filled to the brim of jeans, dresses and
accessories, you only wear a small percentage of the pieces in your wardrobe. Rediscover
the clothes you’ve neglected at the back of your cupboard; spend a bit of time thinking
about how to re-wear or re cut old favourites, this is a free and sustainable way to
update your look. Uniformity If you spend ages standing clueless in front of your
wardrobe, distressingly trying to find something great to wear to work while in a mad rush
and trying not to be late, establishing a uniform could be perfect for you. Curating a
capsule of the pieces you know work for you and your environment will save hours of
frantic searching every day! Wear it or gift it Keeping your wardrobe clean, concise and
curated will bring you inner peace (or something close to it!) so regular charity
donations and gifting to friends will help you on your way to a more streamlined space. To
find out what you should get rid of, try the hanger trick – place all your hangers in one
direction and in three months evaluate how many have been turned to discover what you’ve
actually worn. Smart investments Develop your own rules about what you will and will not
splash out on, focussing on staples and classics and ditching that penchant for the latest
must-have fad – despite what Instagram may tell you, most people don’t invest in wacky,
seasonal pieces. Treat your wardrobe well Whether you’re guilty of throwing sort-of-worn
clothes onto a pile for days on end or simply don’t head to The Laundromat as often as
you’d like, focus on looking after the pieces you have. Making one small change could
extend the life of your favourite items. Fold investment pieces in tissue paper, keep your
shoes in their boxes or shoe bags and air your wardrobe out. Think about what’s underneath
If you’re haunted by the old adage of wearing matching lingerie for fear of being struck
down by a bus in your least stylish underwear, make 2017 the year in which you take heed.
Lingerie is only getting more feminine and luxurious, and with affordable lovely lingerie
readily available here, it doesn’t have to cost an arm and a leg to make yourself feel
better from the bottom up. Your comment (*)",3861
life_fashion90_31_Ruwanthi_Gajadeera_emerges_as_first_Runner_Up.pdf,"Ruwanthi Gajadeera emerges as first Runner Up
Jul 13 2021. It was applause all-around at the AOD when Ruwanthi Gajadeera one of their
own students was declared the first runner up at the Graduate Fashion Week International
Catwalk London. Representing Sri Lanka with her brand Kaeli, this is not the first time
Ruwanthi has tasted success internationally as a couple of months ago she reached the
semi-finals of the Redress Design Award. What was your experience at The Redress Design
Competition? It was a very educational journey for me, and the competition enlightened me
with many opportunities for sustainable fashion. As a practising sustainable designer, it
helped me to pave my path of being an environmental activist through fashion. The fashion
industry is one of the most environmentally polluting industries in the world. This
redress competition thought me to educate everyone around me and to convert them to be
sustainable. This competition truly converted me to join the global mission carried on by
Orsola de Castro, Dr Christina Dean, Ellen MacArthur Foundation and many more. What does
your brand Kaeli represent? ‘Kaeli’ means pieces in my native tongue and the main
inspiration behind my concept was to bring pieces of waste fabrics together to create
innovative textiles by incorporating diminishing heritage craftsmanship. My concept
attempts to combine environmental and social aspects to create impactful garments that
will benefit the wearer by providing a durable and quality product, produced by empowering
the marginalised artisans and most importantly mother earth by designing responsibly. In
terms of design, my garments pass on an ethos of timelessness by embracing a low tech high
tech techniques that express 3Rs in the complete garment lifecycle. How would you describe
your collection? “No one saves us but ourselves. No one can and no one may. We must walk
the path.”- BUDDHA is a quote I was inspired by. My graduate collection is my emotional
journey through Japan as a physical expression. This tour was a spiritual journey of
identifying myself and exploring Japanese philosophies and my background as a child
growing up in a Buddhist family. I express my thoughts through similar cultural
occurrences and experiences through this collection since it helped me to understand who I
am as a person/ artist and a designer. I have expressed it through 6 looks and 6 concepts.
It was challenging to bring out my perspectives through sustainable textile weaving. I
wove each weft with several colours to express my mood and emotional connection with the
philosophy which I wanted to follow with each look. This collection speaks about me as
what I have felt throughout growing up and to this date. This is the path which I have
walked, and these garments are myself. What is your vision for the brand? My vision has
been about exploring sustainable fashion avenues and practices since the very beginning of
the degree. I seek to incorporate my Sri Lankan heritage and sustainable methods of
ancient Sri Lankan culture to support slow fashion and to produce eco-friendly garments. I
believe that as upcoming designers; we have an enormous duty to create eco-friendly trends
since the fashion industry has become one of the most polluting industries in the world.
Personally, through my designs, I communicate the importance of slow movement. I attempt
to demonstrate that slow fashion could be as contemporary and trendy as fast fashion. It
is unquestionably far superior to fast fashion in terms of quality and durability. A
timeless garment could truly explore its life story and depth of design. As designers, we
have so much power as well as a responsibility to change the world by producing timeless
pieces. How did you achieve this result through fabrication? I used zero-waste, upcycling,
reconstruction techniques that not only produce a low-waste garment but also display the
interrelations of these different methods in a cohesive manner. Zero-waste techniques have
allowed me to breathe new life into the textile by combining waste thread and yarn with
heritage crafts such as patchwork, crochet, bobbin lace and handloom to produce innovative
textiles. By using end-of-roll textiles and cut-and-sew waste,I was able to upcycle them
into timeless pieces. I was able to collect preloved denim that I was able to repurpose bydeconstructing them in a fashion that allowed me to embody them into my collection through
patchwork techniques. What techniques did you employ? Incorporating both conventional and
innovative techniques to ensure that my collection only makes use of low-impact materials
and techniques. The collection uses low impact materials such as unbleached raw cotton,
biodegradable buttons and fasteners made using regenerated cellulose; employing hand-woven
handloom, crochet and bobbin lace that does not consume any fossil fuels in terms of
production. It uses natural dyeing techniques using native plants that produce original
colour dyes without releasing harmful chemicals to the planet, moreover, wastewater from
the dyeing process can be safely repurposed to water plants. Furthermore, as for high tech
processes this collection employs Ozone bleaching and laser printing techniques. What are
the unique aspects of this collection? Longevity is hard-wired to the design as mentioned
earlier, this collection aims to bring sentimental value to its wearer by employing
heritage crafts such as boro mending techniques and timeless design aspects. It aims to be
a generational garment that would ideally be passed down from generation to generation as
it can be easily mended using the boro technique. The longevity of the garments are
justified by the colour palette as well as it employs worn-out colours, furthermore, some
garments of this collection have strong androgynous and gender fluid elements to them
appealing it a wider audience even as a second-hand garment. This philosophy of mending of
a robe is a long passing practice made by Buddhist monks to be minimalistic to attain
enlightenment and along the way to be less damaging to the environment since the mental
balance and environmental balance has a core relation and it has coexisted since the
beginning of mankind. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel,

life_fashion90_31_Sri_Lankas_traditional_New_Year_and_its_effect_on_Fashion.pdf,"Sri Lanka’s traditional New Year and its effect on Fashion
Apr 22 2025. Each year, Avurudu celebrations bring about a vibrant explosion to our
wardrobes either as gifts or purchases. Once in my childhood it was a bright yellow that
needed to be mixed and managed, or a royal purple that blossomed into traditional wear
that felt like an acquired taste. No matter the colour, the Aluth Avurudu period brings
together communities through this one aspect that I wanted to draw some special attention
just in case you missed it. One of the most fascinating aspects of this festival for me is
the emphasis on auspicious coloured clothing; Most of us take the directive quite blindly
from whichever source we read or listen to and allow it to play a central role in the
rituals and traditions of the coming New Year celebrations. But little do we recognize
that these colours are not just decorative; they carry deep cultural, historical, and even
astrological significance that have faded into obscurity. The tradition of incorporating
auspicious colors into New Year celebrations dates back centuries by all historical
accounts. Even in ancient records, the selection of these colours was a meticulous process
guided by astrologers in the hopes of uniting communities and families. In Vedic
astrology, certain colours are considered auspicious and are linked to planetary
alignments and zodiac signs. For example, red is associated with Mars and Aries, while
yellow is linked to Jupiter and Sagittarius. These colours are believed to bring positive
energy and harmony when used appropriately; they were also believed to bring good fortune,
prosperity to the home and to the nation with each ritual they were associated with. Now
thanks to a widely accessible ‘Litha’ (Sinhalese Almanac formulated by the foremost
astrological experts) that’s eagerly anticipated towards the end of each year - even
online – every mass market or retail clothing brand you know is keen on its information to
start designs and purchasing so that they are ready for the upcoming period. Most families
eagerly await the announcement of the ""nekath"" (auspicious times) and the corresponding
colours to wear as mentioned in the Litha. While staunch belief and practice might be hazy
on all the steps involved in the traditions of the new year, most people still rigidly
follow the auspicious colours as a ‘better safe than sorry’ approach to ensuring a
prosperous year ahead. To most of rural Sri Lanka, the tradition of auspicious colours
remains a cherished aspect of Avurudu celebrations. These colours influence everything
from the attire people wear to the decorations in their homes and even the food served
during the celebrations. As Sri Lanka continues to evolve, so too does the celebration of
Aluth Avurudu. The significance of these colors goes beyond aesthetics. By embracing the
auspicious colours, people feel a sense of connection to their cultural heritage and the
cosmic rhythms that govern their lives. The tradition of auspicious colors is likely to
remain a cornerstone of the festival, but it may also adapt to modern sensibilities. For
example, with the growing emphasis on sustainability, there could be a shift towards using
eco-friendly materials and natural dyes to incorporate these colours into clothing.
Currently Avurudu period ensures a strong uptick in traditional crafts related purchases
and a strong move towards traditional clothing such as Handloom, Batiks and locally
produced clothing. The auspicious colours of Sri Lanka's New Year celebrations are more
than just a visual delight; they are a vibrant thread that weaves together history,
culture, and community. As the festival continues to evolve, these colours will
undoubtedly remain a symbol of hope, renewal, and unity, reminding us of the timeless
beauty of tradition in a rapidly changing world. As much as Avurudu brings together a warm
fuzzy feeling across the country over traditions and families, it is a celebration that is
much anticipated by the commercial industries of the country. Fashion retailers and
clothing brands invest heavily into this season offering clothing for every aspect of the
celebration as well as gift giving. Most of the items on offer are balloon sleeved or
print pocketed which limits use for just this period, but most consumers are none thewiser and happy to purchase new items for use. Most avurudu purchases end up being one-off
items that are never thought of again for the rest of the year until it’s a paduru party,
hopper night or another unironic sarong related event. If you are someone who purchased
your auspicious coloured clothing with some foresight, the more solid coloured or minimal
styled items could easily be split and paired and used for the day to day or even special
occasions. Avurudu clothing might be another factor on the negative side of fast fashion,
but Sri Lankans rarely throw away clothes to landfills unless it's in tatters, so there is
always that silver lining. I highly recommend giving these items a try in your monthly
rotation; if not, donate or pass on to a friend who might benefit from it. There was a
strange intersection this year between the auspicious colour of the year being Copper and
most fashion retailers offering us a range of rich reds and bright browns. I wonder if it
had anything to do with this year's Pantone Colour of the year being “Mocha Mousse” – a
lovely shade of brown on its own, and the sudden uptick of brown as a Gen-Z adult
favourite. From trousers to crop tops to cable knit polos, Mocha and Copper are colours
that are widely available at the moment in Sri Lanka. Maybe this is the one year Avurudu
clothing can be a whole year long exercise in slow fashion. Or maybe even reach deeper
into those wardrobes, reminisce about Avurudus that have passed by wearing colours that
are definitely not the auspicious color of the year, but give you a certain sense of
nostalgia for the luck or prosperity they brought at that time. A fashion stylist with a

life_fashion90_32_Colombo_Fashion_Week_2018_Kicks_Off_With_Art_Connect.pdf,"Colombo Fashion Week 2018 Kicks Off With ‘Art Connect’
Mar 20 2018. At the iconic heritage building Laksala at York Street, Art Connect kicked
off Colombo Fashion Week (CFW) 2018 on the 20th of March 2018. In its third installment,
six Sri Lankan artists got together to showcase their work under the theme ‘Co-liberate’.
Running along the theme, their work will also be inspired by the designers showcasing at
CFW’s Summer 2019 show. Speaking to the CEO of Swim Week Colombo, Fazeena Rajabdeen, tells
us she ‘enjoys this part the most’. “What better way to celebrate iconic places and spaces
in Sri Lanka than with the best artists in town!” Founder and President of Colombo Fashion
Week, Ajai Vir Singh was thrilled to be hosting this platform for the second time. “It’s
amazing.The idea is for the period of one week, to share the momentum that we have among
all the other creative industries. We bring art on one day, music on another, film
afterwards and then we bring in fashions. We then collectively celebrate Colombo as a
creative center”. Pradeep Chandrasiri A collection of works that began in 2015, the art is
about the power politics that are repressed by the state ideological mechanism on a
superficial surface. An artist for over 30 years, most of his work is focused around his
personal memories and their connections to the political arena. “Film, theatre, literature
or fashion there is no hierarchy for me and that’s why I got involved in Art Connect. This
series is about beauty but I also question what’s hidden beneath the beauty and each
painting has something hidden inside; a human action or a human emotion” Sujeewa Kumari
Inspired by imaginary images, her work is a combination of physical and mental sensations
representing poetic and emotional expressions. Her collection used mixed media on paper in
various female forms. “I was inspired by a dress from one of the fashion designers and
I’ve used her colours for the collection and I’ve used the collage technique by using my
own images which I’ve cut and pasted” Pala Pohupitiye Confronting issues of colonialism
and nationalism, Pala’s two-part series ‘My ID’ and ‘Self Portraits ’ raised the question
of identity by using the lion motif throughout his work. Showcasing at the show was also
the work of his father, Somasiri Pothupitiye, one of the last costume designers for
southern ritual dances. “I was influenced by my father, a traditional dancing costume
designer. And I did a two series collection with two painting for each series” Kavan
Balasuriya This series details a progression of abstractions informed by organic motifs
exploring the relationships between impermanence, negative space and metaphorical shadow
play. “I’m really enjoying being a part of CFW and Art Connect. This collection was built
up over time and this collection is very organic and different from what I normally do. I
started with a monochromatic colour palette so you can see the controlled colours .”
Koralegedara Pushpakumara Using artistic strategies and idioms, he expresses the socio-
political existence in post-war Sri Lanka since 2009. The artwork articulates the
strategically organized state mechanism and power groups that execute inhuman actions in
similar but separate ways. “I use a lot of personal experiences and post-war situations in
traditional motifs to depict my take on it. It’s great to express my views and opinions on
a platform like this” Mahen Perera This collection explores the innate mutability of
materials that move between painting and sculpture. The material he works with takes on
traces of history, time and memory. “These are mainly experimental work on how designers
work relates to my work. My work reveals the notion of body and clothing . It’s always
been interesting to partner up with CFW. They always find interesting places to have our
work presented!” We also caught up with some avid art lovers for their thoughts on the
collections; “I just feel that the inspiration behind this, this place and these artists,
itself is such an inspiration. It’s an amazing idea to have a show like this at a place
like this” – Jaishree “Art always works in different ways so it’s a fantastic medium to
put across to people.” – Jay “Art Connect takes spaces and converts them completely into
something beyond the gallery. The art is absolutely stunning” – Prassad Pictures by: ManojRatnayake and Kushan Pathiraja Law Graduate, food and travel enthusiast and full time dog

to learn how the world of retail works, creativity is one thing but selling what you
design is an art that you need to master. You have to reach your market with the designs
you make. Understanding your customer, knowing how to present your product with a workable
price and predicting upcoming trends, aligning with your collections is all a part of a
sustainable retail model. How to creatively curate a product that a customer wants is the
most important part that any designer must learn. What is your fashion advice? I think the
most important thing is to own one's style is confidence. If you are confident in what you
are wearing, others opinions doesn't really matter. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

life_fashion90_32_Fashionably_Danu_-_Leonardo.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu - Leonardo
Mar 21 2017. Today on the fashion feature, I speak about a trendsetting brand, which
touches our island lifestyle from their collection of shirts which are made to suit any
event and time of day. For this episode, I worked with Arun Tiwari, Head Of Design and
Product Development at Emerald International PVT LTD. Arun is known for the experimental
approach to design and high level of quality and perfection and graduated with an award
winning collection, Earthen Canvas in 2007, a tribute to Indian farmers. And today using
many patterns in a one look kind of work, we experimented a few easy looks for us to
follow. What's unique about this range of shirts? The fabric, feel and the fit. The
perfect sophistication for a gentleman! What is the inspiration when you pick your
collection? Exclusivity and simplicity. What do you feel about the fashion market in Sri
Lanka? Possibilities! Social media plays a decisive role in making this market aware, and
interaction of new trends which is bringing acceptance by educating people about fashion
and being fashionable. Do you feel that your customers like to take risks in choosing
shirts, and move from the safe blues, grays and blacks? Yes! The customers are becoming
more trend cautious and ready for colour quotients. What are the looks you featured in
this shoot? Relaxed formals, fashion formals, classy evening and smart casuals. What look
is in fashion now? And how can a Sri Lankan man make it work in this hot country? The
1950s style. A pair of chinos / Bermuda shorts and refined lightweight shirting fabrics
(prints and washed casuals) as well as premium hand-feel fabrics in saturated colours
gives the look and feel in a Sri Lankan context. How do you match your body and buy a good
fitted shirt - what would you say is the simple way to do it? What new collection does
Leonardo have for the new year? A refined and premium range of structural Dobby / solid
designs curated in absolute sophisticated styles and trendy colours. What should one look
out for in choosing a shirt for office / evening? First, the fit and then comfort. What
advice would you say is the latest trend for a summer country like us? Carefree smart
casual silhouettes in streetwear styling. Speaking to Arantha, who has been the man with
the lens, about this ready to wear brand, and his experience shooting this collection,
this is what he had to say! What were your thoughts on the collection at Leonardo? The
men’s shirt collection at Leonardo was good. The fit is the main factor when it comes to
shirts. I guess they do it well in that area. As it's a BIG lineup of designs, what are
your thoughts on the choices? My personal choice would be more comfy material shirt
designs by them. They should consider doing more linen collections to suit the Sri Lankan
market. What would you say is trending now for a good look for a man? Well, when it comes
to shirts, I would say more slim fit shirts are always in style as well as Chinese collar
shirts, which are very much in style. Designer: Leonardo Photographer: Arantha Sirimanne

life_fashion90_32_HSBC_CFW_21_Emerging_Designers_Unveiled.pdf,"HSBC CFW ‘21: Emerging Designers Unveiled
Mar 25 2021. This evening under the glare of the spotlight 11 emerging designers will take
to the ramp to showcase their collection. Undergoing an extensive selection process
followed by three months of intense training and mentoring these 11 young designers from
various design educational establishments in the country are set to take centre stage at
the HSBC Colombo Fashion Week at the Shangri-La, Colombo. 1- Navindri Ranatunga After
graduating with a degree in Fashion and Textile Design from AoD, Colombo Navindri launched
her graduate collection at PR in April 2020 under the “PR Rising Star” program, Since
then, Navindri has been working on her own fashion label “Navynti”. This season at CFW the
Navynti collection “Tales of a Path”, draws inspiration from ancient Sri Lankan flags for
its textile development, and garments from different communities in the island for its
silhouette development. The color palette for this collection comprises soft earthy color
tones—yellow and gold, pink, blue, purple, red and orange. The collection mainly uses
silk, raw silk and cotton blend fabrics as material. Various types of pleating and
frilling methods have been used as silhouette techniques. For textile development, digital
printing techniques such as sublimation printing, also known to be one of the most
sustainable printing techniques in the fashion industry have been used. Hand-painted
motifs that draw from and play with ancient imagery and figures have been transformed into
digital prints and layered with fragments of various hand embroidered motifs. 2- Hasindu
Jayasingha An undergraduate at the Department of Integrated Design of University of
Moratuwa, Hasindu is a designer and an avid textile artist with years of experience in the
field. He has mastered techniques pertaining to but not limited to batik art, eco dyeing
and printing which are very iconic to Sri Lankan culture. He likes to champion a
philanthropic view through his brand Medusa Ceylon. In a world where violence is forgiven
but speaking of it is forbidden and considered taboo by societal norms, Hasindu uses
fashion as the medium of communication to empower the unspoken stories, to give them a
voice, and to reshape damaged personalities. In his recent work with children, he is
influenced by the tragedy of a young girl abused by her own father. In her paintings, she
symbolised a blue bird as a metaphor for his genitalia. This was a Sri Lankan cultural
parental norm of addressing male genitalia as “chu kurulla”, roughly translated to “pee
bird” in English. This bird plays a pivitol role in his collection. In addition to
educating Sri Lankans on the importance of sex education, he also has emphasized child
abuse in the patrilineal society to help those affected overcome their fears. The erratic
colour palette of the collection is inspired by the stories embedded in the art of the
abuse survivors. He has used organic cotton as the fabric of choice, with embroidery
intertwined with batik. 3- Chamanka Pehesara Having started his journey at CFW last year
Chamanka has attempted to invent a new point of view in fashion. He aims to elevate the
idea of clothing into something powerful, sexy and elegant. Luxury and craftsmanship is
the DNA of his own brand. He wants to talk to the new generation, especially the Instagram
generation who is looking for revelation and rebel. In this collection, his idea is to
‘release the beast’ - to push out the powerful and fearless side of women. A strong woman
intimidates boys and excites men is the idol image for this collection. The collection is
inspired by the beasts in nature. “Embrace the lioness, take the power of the tigress in
you and be sexy for yourself not because someone told you to but because you want to” he
says. He has mixed hard fabrics like suede and faux leather and his colour palette is
based on elegance and luxury. 4- Nisansala Deegala Emerging as the top of her batch when
she graduated from the University of Moratuwa. in 2018, Nisansala won the MAS award for
best overall student in 2017. Her awards include winning the Chokolaate mother-daughter
fashion show in 2016 and being awarded the title for the most outstanding designer in the
UOM graduation fashion show 2018. Her collection named “First concept” is about highfashion-driven, conceptual, conscious fashion full of life and splendour which bridges
past and future. To the First concept, circularity is paramount. Nisansala has used brass
in her collection with the intention of recognizing an age old industry and helping to
revive a dying traditional craft.The key focus is the sophistication of the silhouettes.
Unexpected cutout placements tap into the subversive sexiness and conceal-and-reveal
trend. The colour Lazuli Blue and mango sorbet are used to marry the concept of the past
and the future along with the natural brass colour. High-quality materials have been used
which are committed to prolonging such as soft jute, crepe and unbleached rib-knitted
materials. 5- Ishani Rajapaksha A student specializing in fashion and lifestyle design at
the University of Moratuwa, Ishani is currently experimenting with and experiencing the
fashion industry to increase her knowledge and launch her brand. She is interested in Sri
Lankan traditional crafts and has worked with Dumbara weaving, beeralu and batik crafts.
She has decided to incorporate “lines” as her main focus to bring out a new fashion
aesthetic in cooperation with Sri Lankan crafts. She is working on her brand IRAK which
represents lines as the main focus. Her collection features pleated batik which reveals
the journey of working women with a line aesthetic. The colour palette contains 5 colours,
blue, white, beige, pink and black. Every single colour has a meaning and the alignment of
the colours represent the journey of powerful women. The silhouettes are a combination of
masculine and feminine looks made in muslin and silk. 6- Naduni Katuwandeniya A Fashion
and Lifestyle Design undergraduate student of University of Moratuwa Naduni is passionate
about doing nature-inspired designs and loves to work with sustainable crafts. This is her
first collection for her brand TANDRA and comprises occasion wear and resort wear. Her
designs are based on the craft industry in Sri Lanka and her main target is to give a
modern look to the traditional craft industry. All her silhouettes and colors are inspired
by nature and she tries to use contrasting color palettes with detailed craft. This
collection is done with Beeralu craft and is inspired by the beauty of the ocean.
Monochromatic colours are used because she wanted to give a modern look to the traditional
Beeralu craft. The Silhouettes are inspired by the sea creatures and the old Sinhala
traditional clothes, sleeves play a major role in a design therefore she paid little extra
attention to make the sleeves as dramatic as possible using Beeralu crafts to show the
rhythm of the human body. 7- Nipunika Fernando A fashion and costume designer who has
experience in creating garments for casual, event, costume and avant-garde wear,
Nipunika’s designs focus on sustainability and Sri Lankan design elements. She received
her Bachelor of Design from LCI Melbourne in 2019, majoring in Fashion and Costume and
minoring in Graphic Design, for which she also received the Dean’s Award of High
Distinction. She has showcased her designs in two runways for the Virgin Australia
Melbourne Fashion Festival, for the years 2018 and 2019. She believes a person’s style is
an expression of themselves and considers this when creating custom pieces for clients.
Nipunika views clothing as a method of storytelling, as people make conscious decisions
about what they wear depending on their mood, personal style, and environment. Her brand
Naikava aims to add a Sri Lankan touch to everyday wear using traditional motifs and
silhouettes. Her collection Sanni St. aims to bring traditional Sri Lankan motifs into
street and event wear using a modern take on the iconic Sanni face, incorporated into
comfortable, versatile garments. This collection features numerous pleats in wrap skirts
and dhoti pants along with collared shirts and fitted blouses. The strict pleats of the
Kandyan Osari and the flowing gathers of a Sari are made into detachable pieces, providing
a new way to add a Sri Lankan touch to any outfit. The garments in this collection are
made from locally crafted handloom in a shimmering gold, brought together with ivory and
chocolate brown linens. Utilising natural textiles and coconut fixings, sustainability is
woven into the very fibre of this collection. 8- Kavishna Kuruwitage. A past student from
Lyceum International School (Wattala) Kavishna is currently interning at MAS Katunayake asa designer. She started off her designing journey through AOD. and a nursery graduation
ceremony. Her brand MARKU represents her personality which portrays who she is and who she
strives to be as a person. Falling in love with batik, one of the most beautiful crafts
that Sri Lankan tradition holds has paved a way for her to create intricate details and
explore and experiment with new ways to create various textiles. Her collection titled
Skeletal Dimensions is a womenswear collection inspired by 1980’s men’s workwear clothing.
It combines the juxtaposition between the human skeleton structure and its mindsets. The
silhouettes show the bold, tomboyish persona that she portrays. The technique that she has
used through batik is a reversible method that creates a clean refined technique on one
side and an abstract textured effect on the reverse side. This technique is shown through
most of the pieces within the collection. The use of fabrics includes cotton, linens and
silks. Trying to start being responsible in fashion she has incorporated natural buttons
which are made from recycled plastic and some of it are also made from the extracts of
fruits. 9- Akash Paranavithana Akash is fond of doing abstract concepts. His designs
concentrate on zero waste patterns and upcycled patterns in garments, He also likes to
work with unconventional materials and make them wearable. He focuses on jewellery and
accessory making as well to enhance brand and has more variety and he believes that it is
also a way to come up with designs to recycle leftover materials. His brand MAEL CEYLON is
a brand that focuses on highs Streetwear and accessories. His collection is about how a
person's emotions become more stable with age. The amount of pure emotion that a person
shows is blocked and faked because of various factors. The loss of freedom to show what a
person truly feels has a good side as well as a bad side to it and this is what he tries
to showcase through his collection. 10- Hashani Fernando Hashani is a final year
undergraduate at University of Moratuwa . She has gained Professional experience with MAS
Linea Aqua Hanwella, as a trainee designer as well as a product developer through her
knowledge and confidence as a fashion designer. OCTO Atelier is a brand where she
initiated to showcase her own designer pieces. It’s a sustainable fashion brand that
promotes undergone fashion concepts and techniques due to technological advancement.
Crochet, Beeralu, macramé and organic dying techniques are the key elements of the brand.
Her collection for the show is called “Cottage soul” and is a reflection of the simplicity
of cottage life. The key design element is hand crocheting. Calm earthy tones and shades
of green enrich the collection in order to exhibit the correlation they had with the
environment. The Cottage soul collection was inspired with the intention of showing the
simplicity we all had ages ago before industrialization. 11- Divya Jayawickrama Divya
graduated with a B.A. Fashion Design from the University College of Ratmalana in 2019. Her
graduation collection was awarded the Best Menswear Collection of the Year at her
graduation fashion show. Radical patternmaking, textile development, bold manipulations
and meticulous research go hand in hand with her ambition and will to create something new
and modern. Divya designs with sustainability in mind and uses no waste, reversible and
convertible techniques in her collections. Her debut clothing brand “DIVYA93”, is a unisex
brand that was launched at Colombo Fashion Week Summer 2020. This collection is inspired

narrative more accurately. Hand block printing has been used mainly in her collection to
express her ideas with handcraft design. The fabric has been developed through surface
dying, block printing and also through natural ayurvedic protection using neem and
turmeric. This collection is targeted at the high-end millennials. Voluminous, traditional
formalwear and vintage looks have been merged into her collections. Tina Edward

life_fashion90_32_Local_batik_design_label_La_Pard_is_going_to_Milan.pdf,"Local batik design label La Pard is going to Milan
Sep 15 2023. Milan Fashion Week is a clothing trade show held semi-annually in Milan,
Italy and was established in 1958 as one of the big 4 global fashion weeks – Paris,
London, New York and Milan. Upcoming Spring/ Summer collections are showcased in
September/ October of each year. It is one of the most important fashion events worldwide.
There are more than 40 shows each season and the city is transformed into a tourist hub by
transforming some of the most exciting locations in the city to showcase design. Parallel
there are several fringe events which take place while all the focus is on the city for
fashion. One such event is the Runway Show by Fashion Vibes, which is taking place on 21
and 22 September 2023. La Pard has been selected to participate and this will be Dinushi’s
first showcase on foreign soil. Local design label La Pard will be participating and
showcasing their latest collection at this event on Day 1. Dinushi Pamanuwa’s label La
Pard started its journey in 2016 with an innovative use of batik in luxury lingerie. This
is how the label launched in-store at PR, the same year. In 2017, Dinushi applied her
unique style of batik to ready-to-wear and she participated in her first runway show at
SLDF in 2016 and thereafter was on the main ramp of CFW in 2019. La Pard is a luxury batik
clothing brand, born in the tropical island of Sri Lanka by founder and designer Dinushi
Pamunuwa. The brand focuses on lingerie, nightwear, resort wear and evening wear and it’s
all designed and manufactured in Sri Lanka. Each piece by this label is unique due to the
handcrafted nature of batik textiles. La Pard was founded in 2016 with batik lingerie made
from soft luxurious silks and embellished with lace. La Pard then progressed into luxury
nightwear, then resort wear, always with her unique identity in batik – a geometric and
organic pattern style. Thereafter, La Pard moved into ready-to-wear and has since
showcased on the main ramp at CFW in 2019, presenting both ladies’ wear and men’s wear
which has for the brand’s 7 years, been available exclusively at PR. La Pard’s art and
focus has always been batik. Dinushi infuses this now local well-known and exercised craft
in her own unique manner. La Pard's colour combinations and patterning is unique and this
label has developed a loyal following of customers who often seek out her signature
silhouettes. Batik is a traditional wax-resistant fabric dyeing technique that has been in
Sri Lanka for decades, handed down from one generation to the next most likely via
Indonesia during the Dutch Period in then-Ceylon. It is a time-consuming and laborious
handmade craft that creates a unique design on the fabric as the wax breaks and the dye
seeps in, creating what is seen as crackles or cracks. Batik is therefore also an
unpredictable craft, which is one of the multiple aspects that makes it unique and
sustainable. Each piece is always unique and one of a kind. La Pard focuses on creating
unique items of clothing and accessories while focusing on sustainability in ‘slow
fashion’. La Pard creates capsule collections and made-to-order garments and steers clear
of mass production. Luckily the craft won’t permit otherwise. Dinushi works closely with
batik artisans to develop new ways to use the craft and uplift the lives of the
communities involved with her process and work. Ethical manufacturing practices are in
place to make sure each worker gets the same love and care the customers are given. La
Pard was featured in British Vogue's October issue in 2022 and has participated at SLDF
and Colombo Fashion Week shows since the brand’s inception. The Spring /Summer 2024
collection that is to be showcased at Milan Fashion Week in September 2023 is inspired by
Dinushi’s tropical homeland Sri Lanka, particularly the hills and often misty hometown
Kandy. The use of different batik prints will depict the story of the designer’s journey
from the town of Kandy to the city of Colombo – the commercial hub of the country – while
focusing on wildlife, flora and fauna, and other attractions in the picturesque island of
Sri Lanka. (Pix Courtesy: La Pard) Your comment (*)",4214

life_fashion90_32_The_Cutting_Edge_in_Weaving_Woven_by_Kandygs.pdf,"The Cutting Edge in Weaving: Woven by Kandygs
Jun 20 2019. Passed down throughout the ages, weaving is an art that is richly embedded in
Sri Lankan culture and tradition. However, three young designers from Kandygs Handlooms
have worked tirelessly to bring the traditional art of weaving to the attention of a
modern audience through their innovative designs. As one of the forerunners in the
handlooms industry, Kandygs Handlooms has been a prominent figure in the manufacture and
retail of home textiles in Sri Lanka and globally for over 48 years winning numerous
awards. With a loyal customer base and a product range that has expanded from fabrics and
curtaining to table linen, bed linen, clothing, sarees and accessories, Kandygs have not
slowed down by any means. Utilizing natural fibres, such as cotton and bamboo, they focus
on redefining the boundaries on sustainability. On the 13th of June 2019, at 05.00pm at
the outlet in Colombo 5, Kandygs Handlooms introduced the three young designers and their
collections. Dinuri Nanayakkara, Chanduli Senanayake and Sarala Wettasinha are aspiring,
young designers paving the pathway towards new dimensions of hand woven designs. A Natural
Success Speaking with Isuri Nanayakkara, the granddaughter of the founders and now the
General Manager of Kandygs Handlooms regarding the new collections and the progression of
Kandygs in general, she expressed her pride in the works of the designers and explained
that their innovation, creativity and especially the variety of designs would secure an
“edge in the market”. She explained the fast movement of Kandygs towards the use of
natural dyes generated from the use of raw turmeric, paththigi and other weeds. Expressing
her eagerness to make weaving as environmentally friendly and sustainable she credited
bamboo fabric and natural dyes as the “sustainable option for the future” as the act of
weaving combined with the use of natural dyes ensure minimal wastage of finite resources.
She also emphasized that Kandygs Handlooms ensures that plants that have multiple
alternative uses for perhaps medical reasons are not utilized so as to ensure that the
plants do not deplete in quantity and that usage is ethical. The use of bamboo provides a
natural sheen making it a substitute for silk and thus avoids the cruel killing of
silkworms that are boiled alive in their cocoons causing the cocoons to unravel, allowing
access to the silk threads. The Innovation behind the Creations Dinuri Nanayakkara
schooled at Ladies College and later attended West Herts College in the United Kingdom.
Inspired by her mother, the director of design at Kandygs Handlooms, she paints without
hesitation, coupling colours that contrast together with abstract designs. She enjoys
creating bolder patterns and perseveres tirelessly to create the most colourful designs.
Chanduli Senanayake, educated at St. Bridget’s Convent cultivated an interest in art,
graphics and fashion. She later attended the Academy of Design (AoD). Her preference
towards bright colours such as pinks and oranges is evident; her collection while vibrant
has softer designs and conveys simple elegance. “I challenged myself with using darker
colours” said Chanduli in reference to her darker, greyscale collection. In keeping with
Kandygs’ endeavours towards sustainability, Chanduli uses cut pieces of leftover fabric to
make handbags and other accessories in order to ensure that nothing goes to waste. Sarala
Wettasinha, who also attended St. Bridget’s Convent and later AOD with her fellow
designer, uses a more minimalistic approach to her designs. The colours used in her
collection are inspired by emotions. She merged different styles and gave her designs a
unique twist. At an early age, she found herself drawing cartoons in her spare time and
thus developed an interest in art, which she continuously explored. Her designs have a
sophisticated touch to them that resonates with a contemporary clientele. Sustainability
in all forms Kandygs employs weavers in handloom villages and have taken measures to
ensure that these pocket villages are able to generate an income for themselves through a
buy by guarantee approach. They have also shared this market with their competitors such
as Kelani and Fashion Market as the benefits to these villagers far outweigh any costsincurred. “It has rejuvenated the market for handlooms and ensures that the villages are
able to sustain themselves…” said Isuri Nanayakkara. Kandygs are bringing back the art of
weaving with eco-friendly and sustainable awareness. The designs by Dinuri Nanayakkara,
Chanduli Senanayake and Sarala Wettasinha emanate these standards. The familial atmosphere
that radiates from the designers to the sales personnel to the management is evident and
credited by Isuri Nanayakkara, who grew up surrounded by the friendly faces she works
with, as she has taken the reins in guiding Kandygs towards its sustainable future.

life_fashion90_33_Designer_1-2-1_-_Shimalka_Bodaragama.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 - Shimalka Bodaragama
Jan 13 2021. One time model and former air stewardess at Sri Lankan airlines, Shimalka’s
travels across the world encouraged her love for fashion. In 2010 she launched her label
‘Ladies Runway’ which evolved over the years. With time and maturity in fashion, Shimalka
now operates under the label ‘Waves of Glory’ which is an acknowledgement of her deeply
spiritual relationship with God. What sparked your interest in fashion design? My mum was
in Italy studying leather goods designing and I always had an interest in fashion. I
wanted to learn insights into the fashion industry. I started as a model for Colombo
Fashion week in 2008 and I continued to work with different designers. Then I started
flying for Sri Lankan airlines and got the opportunity to see the world and I fell in love
with different cultures and international fashion. While I was at Sri Lankan airlines I
started to study fashion design at Lanka Institute of Fashion Technology in 2009. Then
continued my degree at AOD and graduated in Fashion and Textile designing. What made you
take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Colombo is a very small city and
a small social community. So we all attend the same events. I always wanted to wear
clothes that are not mass-produced. In Colombo even if we pay premium prices we are sure
to bump into someone who is wearing the same item of clothing. This led me to make bespoke
clothing for myself and my friends. I soon realised that there was a design for my
creation and thus started my own workshop with two machines at home. I then started
selling online. How has your work evolved since you began your own label? Being an
entrepreneur is like jumping out of a plane believing your parachute will open and you
will land safely. Every decision is a risk you take. I enjoy running my own business
because I can make my own designs. Having started small I now supply to Urban Island and I
have been working on a luxury evening wear collection for brand LUXE, ODEL. Are there any
types of clothing that you avoid designing? I don’t put myself in a box. I’m always open
to trying new things out of my comfort zone. Where do you look for creative inspiration?
I’m inspired by lifestyles and individual personalities. I don’t really follow trends.
Describe your latest collection? I launched the first collection for LUXE in December.
LUXE is the luxury brand and Waves of Glory, I have been working with a great team at
ODEL. It’s been an interesting project. We have done very limited pieces from each design
to keep it exclusive and I believe this is going to be a success. Who is your muse? I
really admire Kate Middleton. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you
started your company? Never compare your journey to others. It’s your own speed, own
lessons, own journey and own story to tell. Be happy where you are and don’t regret the
times you failed. What’s your motto? Don’t get too attached to making money because it’s
never going to be enough. What role do you think social media plays in fashion today?
Social media enables fashion brands to engage their desired target market, which also
enables consumers to interact with the fashion brand. What is your favourite part about
being a designer? Seeing customer satisfaction How do you want women to feel when wearing
your clothes? Comfortable and confident Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

Mar 06 2018. New York based fashion designer Radhika is known for her trademark
kaftanesque dresses. Free flowing silhouettes form the mainstay of her latest collection
called Rumi’s Child. Creating under her label Lois London, Radhika’s pieces are highly
sought after. Last year she had the distinct honour of taking park in New York Fashion
Week, a huge step up in her successful design career. A free spirited designer, Radhika
delivers exceedingly well on the fashion front. How long have you been a designer for? 10
years now. What inspired this collection? The collection was inspired by this simple
quote: ""I closed my mouth and spoke to you in a hundred silent ways"" - Rumi As always Lois
London is effortlessly expressive. nnnnnnnnn What are the challenging aspects of running a
fashion business in Sri Lanka? At times working remotely from New York can be a challenge
but luckily I have such a great relationship with my production partner in Sri Lanka, so
communication is fluid and we get things done. Where do you retail your stuff? within Sri
Lanka I only retail at PR What is your top fashion tip? Be yourself and allow your style
to reflect your daily mood, whatever that may be Where do you like to shop in Sri Lanka?
Of course I love PR and The Design Collective for a discovering new and exciting designers
but my absolute favorite is seeking out random antique jewelry around the Island. Who is
your muse? I love 70's icons like Bianca Jagger and other muses from the Studio 54 days.
Fashion prediction for next season? Lord knows... I cant follow trends What is fashion no
no? Heels at the beach (not on the sand at least!) Who would you like seeing dressed in
your creations? As far as celebs of course I would love to see Gigi or Bella Hadid wearing
Lois London because they are GORGEOUS!!! But I love seeing real, every day women wearing
it even more, feeling beautiful and confident wearing one of my pieces. That's so much
more fulfilling, Which designers / brands are you influenced by? I’ve always love Chloe I
love the fact that you can either dress them up or down. My tassel earrings are usually
the perfect accompaniment to any Lois London piece. Lightweight and yet make a statement.

life_fashion90_33_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring_-_Stripes_and_Checks.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - Stripes and Checks
Jul 30 2019. A well-cut shirt is always in fashion. It’s the key when it comes to dressing
up, having a sharp shirt can fix most of the problem. And I’m telling you it’s hard to
find one specially when you are tall, it tends to be too short or too big for the sleeves
Stripes and Checks has mastered the art in making a perfectly fitted shirt while
maintaining outstanding Quality. S&C came to life when three friends found it hard to find
shirts which matched their requirements. The company is run by three friends who studied
together in school. The issue for them was the fit and fabric that looked pale and used in
2 to 3 washes. Today ‘Stripes and Checks’ offers a huge variety of shirts from ready-to-
wear and made to Measure. Gajan Vinothan, Kalana Jayasuriya and Udara Rathnayake speak
more on what’s new in stores What made you start ‘Stripes and Checks’, what’s the story?
We found that there was no one single brand where men could get their own perfect shirt
before we started S&C. Men had to make do with basic tailored shirts with no customisation
or off the rack shirts that looked similar to each other that didn't always fit well. We
decided that the time was up to address these issues and offer Sri Lankan men an
opportunity to dress well without having to shop abroad. How do you guys pick your
fabrics? We source our fabrics from top shirting mills across India, China and Japan. Our
suppliers continuously send us fabrics which are currently in trend across the world. We
also make regular visits overseas to see how we can offer our customers innovative fabrics
at reasonable prices. How did you work on the design and the blocks? And how does it work
when it’s made to measure? We’ve listened to our customers and developed specific blocks
for our RTW shirts that cover a wide spectrum of sizes. MTM is truly bespoke sizing,
tailored specifically for the individual customer What role do you think social media
plays in fashion today? Social media plays a crucial role in creating awareness and
building a brand. New trends and styles can be brought to the market, showcased and sold
in a couple of days or weeks. It also helps as a platform to enable e-commerce shopping,
reducing the need to have a brick and mortar facility. Leveraging in social media to
promote a brand is quite inexpensive and reaches a far wider audience than traditional
mediums such as TV and print. Social media gives inspiration to us and the customer. Some
customers would experiment with styles or colours after seeing them on social media and we
are able to bring those diverse tastes to life. Tell me about the collection I am Dressed
in? Its our latest collection and portrays our design capabilities and versatility –
focusing on workwear, casual wear and mixing the combination of the two for people on the
go! The market is very crowded, how do you stand out? We stand out based on three
fundamentals – quality of fabric, designs and attention to detail in our finished garment.
What advice would you give someone who is buying shirts off the rack, What should they
keep in mind when picking their garments? Do not compromise on fit. A well fitted shirt
will keep you looking sharp throughout the day. Fabric quality is important to withstand
repeated washing and ironing. What do you keep in mind when you pick your fabrics? Hand
feel, Composition, durability and ease of maintenance especially in shirts used for formal
occasions. What are the special elements you can bring to a shirt? We offer a wide variety
of customisation options which the wearer can use to bring out his personal sense of
style. Our customers can make a fashion statement by using our services. Shirts need not
be boring. Even a plain white shirt can have subtle detailing that's still suitable for
work but stand out. What are the most selling colours and prints? Whites and shades of
blues are the fastest moving solid colours, and prints which are not too bold generally
tends to sell well. Would you be getting into any other areas of fashion - or would it
always be Shirts? We are exploring other products in the menswear range and hope to launch
these soon offering customers a one-stop shop for their clothing requirements. Everyone
assumes you are expensive, are you? Who is your target market? We began our journeycreating made-to-measure shirts for individuals who wanted the perfect fit in their shirts
whilst being able to customise every element of it from button colours to the type of
collar and even adding a monogram for a touch of personalisation. There was value addition
in this journey and thus warranted a higher price in comparison to an off the rack shirt.
We have now introduced a very comprehensive ready-to-wear collection for all occasions to
make our products more affordable. The prices of our shirts start from Rs.2200 Designers -

Oct 16 2018. Today I feature a young trendy Sri Lankan brand that really captures the
essence of Lanka, so chilled and so summer! The founders Kavita Amaratunga and Nuwan
Perera wanted something that’s fresh in the market that keeps the Lankan vibe. The fit and
feel of the T-shirt is nice. It is perfect for the summer sun in Sri Lanka and priced well
too. The prints speaks our language. You can place your odrer online on their FB page,
this is their second month in the market. Goand support a local brand and talent. What’s
the story behind the Shop .Cuban brand? If me or Nuwan were to be introduced elsewhere,
Shop.Cuban would not be the first thing we mention. I am a psychologist by profession with
my own practice and Nuwan is a businessman with other ventures as well. We had always
wanted to work together and had been sitting on this idea of Shop.Cuban for a while. So, I
suppose this is a merging of our creativity, passion and humour and making it into a
business. We went in pursuit of finding comfortable yet fashionable clothing that would
showcase a wearer's personality as well as making a fashion statement. Shop.Cuban is
fresh, cool, bold, relevant and hopes to meet everyone's tropical need. How long have you
been around? We have been around for just over a month now. We are very new and excited to
provide something different to the Sri Lankan market. What made you start this venture?
Both our mottos have always been comfort- first. But in an increasingly glam society, we
found a gap in the market for comfortable clothing which is also fun and fashionable. The
kind of pieces we have currently are T-shirts that can not only be worn in your down time,
but they are versatile enough to be used as statement pieces in glam settings too. We hope
to continue that model as we expand as well. So really, we just created a brand of
clothing that we would wear. You guys are a team of two, how did you guys meet and who
does what in the mix? We are a couple! We have been together for over two years and
recently engaged. That love story is too long to tell! But that’s how we decided to work
together. We have a good working relationship and make all decisions together. But I focus
on the creative bits, social media content etc, and Nuwan focuses on the business
development side of things, branding/ marketing, logistics and operations etc. All your
looks work with black and white- would you move into colours ? The reason to stick to
basic colours initially came from the small bits of market research we did on what our
target market preferred. We are hoping to move to other colours in our next collection.
Where do you retail and where can one buy your brand? We are primarily an online clothing
brand. You can find us on Instagram and Facebook on Shop.Cuban. With the arrival of all
these new designers, especially in fashion, what sets you apart which will give you
longevity in the market? I think what sets us apart is our focus on using creativity and
humour to make each piece relatable to Sri Lankans. We don’t just give you a t-shirt, we
also give you comfort, a chance to express yourself and sometimes even a good pun or joke.
We hope to continue to curate each piece to cater to this goal of making it relatable.
Because of our focus on creativity, we have opened ourselves to having endless
possibilities in terms of our designs. Thus being able to adapt is what we feel will help
us sustain our business. You guys are specific about keeping it local with your garments,
would you start producing accessories soon ? Definitely. We have been in the works to
expand from just T-shirts to more pieces that would work with a tropical vibe. Hopefully,
by next year we can get going with some of these plans. What’s next for the brand?
Christmas is coming up, so we are in the process of developing a few more pieces for the
season. Expanding our range is important, so we are also working on our new collection and
plans for the next year. Further, we are taking part in a few pop-ups of which details
will be shared soon on our page! What would you say is your biggest inspiration for
designs, and what would you say is your personal style? Both our personal styles are very
much based around being comfortable, and sleek and at the same time. We both wear a lot ofblack and white which is reflected in our products as well. I suppose our biggest
inspiration for our designs is our country, Sri Lanka! There are so many cultural, social,
geographical factors and references to draw from and that is what we are currently doing.

life_fashion90_33_From_Heritage_to_Streetwear_Common_Folk_weaving_a_modern_tal.pdf,"From Heritage to Streetwear: Common Folk weaving a modern tale of innovation
Feb 16 2024. Handloom textile weaving in Sri Lanka is said to date back to the 6th century
BC as early as when Prince Vijaya from India landed in Sri Lanka and first saw Kuveni, a
queen of an indigenous race of Yakshas (demon tribe) spinning yarn at the wheel. Fast
forward to the 21st century, the traditional art and craft is still alive, surviving
industrialization, a brutal civil war and even the recent crisis. Teaming up and pursuing
the art with innovation, is a lawyer and a designer Sharendra Peiris and Thamali
Dharmawardena, co-founders of the handloom textile R&D and innovation brand “Common Folk”.
Since its inception in 2017, their main focus (motto) has been directed towards “uplifting
heritage crafts with technology.” They are the creators behind unique sneakers designed
with handloom. The art of handloom weaving involves the creation of textiles by
interlacing threads primarily made out of cotton (coloured with natural dyes), on a loom
operated manually. Pictured: Thamali Dharmawarden After almost 5 years of research, Common
Folk creates a breakthrough in the industry by discovering a production feasible method
that adds waterproofing functionality and abrasive level durability to traditional
handloom textiles. Sitting with Daily Mirror Life, Dharmawardena gives us an insight into
their story and the evolution of their work. “Common Folk is a homage to all the brilliant
people we have met and collecte dalong the way in the past 7-8 years. Firstly, Sharendra
and I consider ourselves common folk. Throughout the years, we have learned and grown with
the help of our talented artisans, tutors, technology partners, manufacturers, family,
friends, and colleagues. No matter our differences, our passion for our respective crafts
bind us. That passion and commitment make us all Common Folk."" Pictured: Sharendra Peiris
Q TELL US THE STORY OF HOW YOU GOT INTO HANDLOOM WEAVING? WHAT WAS THE INSPIRATION BEHIND
PURSUING THIS TRADITIONAL CRAFT? Being very new to handloom weaving, it is actually less
than ten years since we began pursuing it. The first exposure to the craft was during my
second year in my BA programme. Our college took us to experience many different
traditional crafts. But something about creating a textile from scratch and watching the
weaving process in a handloom intrigued me the most. Being an analytical thinker, I then
dove into researching handloom textiles and the handloom market. During this research, it
became apparent to me that the Sri Lankan handloom market was on a decline. So our goal
became to sustain and uplift it. We started out by wanting to make something new and
unique that would open the handloom craft to much bigger opportunities. After years of R&D
(almost 5 years), we finally found a method to add the waterproof functionality to
handloom textiles. This was a breakthrough moment for us. But adding to our joy, we found
out that our waterproof handloom textiles were very durable, making it feasible to be used
in highly abrasive products. Being two people who love streetwear, Sharendra and I
immediately went for sneakers! Q CAN YOU WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS OF DESIGNING A PAIR
OF SNEAKERS USING HANDLOOM TEXTILE? Initially, we start by selecting yarns and thread
compatible with our waterproofing technology. We also select them in the colours and
thicknesses we need. Our weavers then do their magic to warp the loom into our chosen
design and begin weaving. One thing we didn’t want to compromise on was the natural
sustainability and social sustainability factors of weaving handlooms. So once the designs
are masterfully woven, we clean up the fabric and send it to be waterproofed by our
locally based technology partners.This makes them extra durable too. Once done, we send
them to our shoe manufacturing partners (locally based) to turn our fabric into sneakers.
The entire process takes around 3-4 months. These shoes were the first product we launched
for the retail market. We have fondly named them after some cities and places we hold
dear. Are there any traditional techniques or tools that you incorporate into your weaving
process? Are there any particular designs or patterns that you specialize in? One of our
primary design innovations is the Ombre handloom, where the colours in the fabric areindistinguishable from one another, showing a smooth gradient effect. This technique is
far smoother in transition than any other we have seen in the market. Q YOU SURELY MIGHT
HAVE HAD/HAVE SOME CHALLENGES OR DIFFICULTIES YOU HAVE TO OVERCOME PURSUING TRADITIONAL
HANDLOOM? Yes definitely. We were relatively new to the handloom industry; we did not come
from a family of handloom weavers or have ever experienced anything about handloom before.
So our journey was not quick, short, or easy. But our purpose kept us going and helped us
jump through all the obstacles we encountered. One other thing is our process in handloom
right now is labour-intensive and very lengthy. We are combining three different
industries and markets to create one product, and the most challenging part is
coordinating with each of them to work smoothly. As we both have our day jobs, finding the
time is a big challenge. Everything else in creating the product, missteps and side steps
etc. we encounter are all part of the experience, and we don’t consider them to be
difficulties or challenges. They are more of a motivator for us. Q ASIDE HANDLOOM WOVEN
SNEAKERS, WHAT ARE OTHER PRODUCTS DO YOU WORK WITH? Our main innovation is waterproof
handloom fabrics. With this, we have created a few exciting products, like waterproof bags
and cushion covers. We are now experimenting with handloom umbrellas. We also currently
have 6 different fabric designs in two colourways, but we hope to expand this very soon. Q
COULD YOU SHARE WITH US ANY MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES OR STORIES WHEN BOTH OF YOU BEGAN
PURSUING THIS CRAFT? I would say that all of our interactions with our artisans have been
and are very special to us. We work with one family and we have created an amazing bond
with them. We primarily collaborate with handloom weavers in Madampella. Latha and Bandula
are 2 such handloom artisans who throughout the years, have been our teachers, guides, and
sources of inspiration for Common Folk. Our fondest memory with them falls during the
period when we were developing the Ombre handloom technique. After weeks of experimenting,
we finally got to a point where the colours seamlessly blended and our efforts were
finally rewarded. The excitement and happiness we felt at that moment was unexplainable.
Sharing that with Latha and Bandula and watching the same reaction, when we first took our
shoes to them, made it so much sweeter. Their happiness to see the result of our work has
been the most gratifying feeling we have ever had as a brand. Q DO YOU HAVE ANY ADVICE FOR
SOMEONE INTERESTED IN PURSUING HANDLOOM TEXTILE WEAVING ? The only advice we can give as a
start-up brand for anyone interested is to find your purpose. A shoe is a product, whether
it is made from handloom or not. Our sneakers are special to us because they were just the
beginning of something much more significant. Handlooms in our country have been a part of
our heritage and culture for many years. At one point, we had a thriving industry with
many factories and weaving mills. But in the past few decades,the industry has been
reaching a state of inertia. We see many handloom sellers who produce an identical product
range, often with the same aesthetics. This saturates the local market. So it is exciting
to see a few inspirational local brands stepping out of the norm to create new designs and
colour combinations to uplift the craft. At Common Folk, we believe our handloom sneakers
are just a stepping stone for the industry in Sri Lanka to grow in streetwear culture and
become enticing to the younger generations. text Nuzla Rizkiya Your comment (*)",8008

cotton coupled together with netting and lace. Her collection embodies designs that are
delicate in a disconnected manner and is inspired by the trend of androgynous and boxy
silhouettes. ""In the first part of the collection, I used some women’s movement insignia
and add-on pieces that suggest the rebel. In the second part, I created dreamy and
somewhat disconnected and marionette like silhouettes as a further, perhaps cheeky
expression of the experience."" 'Jai' by Jaish Jaish Jayasinghe launched her label ‘Jai’
back in 2012. A fusion of East and West, her collections are inspired by stories and
experiences. Her collection for CFW 2017, ‘With Love, Jai’ is inspired by Coldplay’s song
‘Birds’. With earthy tones embedded in free-flowing silhouettes, the collection is a
reflection of love and freedom. ""I have used bright colours and graphic images of birds in
this collection. The silhouettes I have used complement the beauty of the feminine form.""
LOVI Ceylon Harvard graduate and former Silicon Valley entrepreneur, Asanka De Mel is the
creator of LOVI Ceylon, a brand of luxury active - wear sarongs. Debuting at CFW, LOVI
Ceylon’s summer collection is titled 'Modern Ceylon' and is inspired by travel, culture
and the future. The collection featured sarongs crafted with handloom cotton and silk was
presented in navy, white and emerald with accents of silver, gold and red. The USP of the
Lovi Ceylon sarong is its thoughtfully placed pocked and belt. ""My collections are meant
to fit the explorer, adventurer in all of us. With this collection we are simultaneously
pushing the limits on the silhouette of the sarong while keeping all the functional
aspects of the LOVI people have come to love."" A label by designer Nilanka De Silva, this
collection features an array of textures of denims and chambray. La Sari presented a
collection inspired by the ocean hues and the setting sun in the form of batiks,
embroidery and embellishments. The blue batiked denim was brought to life with beautifully
embroidered red floral images. ""Denim is one of my favourite fabrics and it is on trend
for 2017. I thought I would create something different using denim along with batik and
embroidery."" Aslam Hussein A bridal and evening wear designer with a distinctive style,
Aslam Hussein’s collection was steeped in medieval background with a feel of antiquity to
it’s name. With dramatic cuts in embossed and embroidered fabrics, the collection mired
historical clothing which demonstrated his love for structured clothing with lush details.
""I am very inspired by medevial styling and clothing so this collection has a bit of
Baroque and a touch of ethereal Elizabethan fashion influences which have helped sit well
with my fashion ethos."" Amilani Perera Amilani Perera is a ready-to-wear, luxury, fashion
brand that incorporates unique chic styling with traditional Sri Lankan cultural motifs.
The brand's two-pronged motive entails providing the wearer with a truly unique piece of
clothing while simultaneously giving back to society in the form of helping protect Sri
Lanka’s wildlife habitat. For her new collection, she draws inspiration from Sri Lanka’s
rapidly dying coral reefs. Her latest collection will feature this season’s latest trend:
hand embroidery on placement motifs and a shift away from traditional methods of beading.
Natural seashells and porcelain ornaments will be woven into the motifs while the
silhouettes are primarily focused on a mix of structure and fluidity. ""This collection is
all about giving something back to nature along with giving the wearer a very uniqueexperience."" Ramona Oshini Having launched her brand at CFW in 2010 and showcased at CFW
for 8 consecutive seasons, Ramona Oshini’s collection 'The Divine Empress' gets its
inspiration from women of royalty and incorporates trends such as gold detailing on
fabrics and prints on a range of materials such as tulle, linen, pure silk, velvet and
brocade. The colour palette of the collection ranged from subtle hues of ivory and grey to
bold accents of gold and fuchsia. The incorporation of the artisanal beeralu lace also
added a touch of elegance into the collection. ""Our silhouettes focus largely on
complementing the Sri Lankan woman and this collection is everything about what the women
of royalty had stood up for and celebrates the power of being in power."" Gaetano Navarra

Mar 27 2021. After two days of back to back fashion, HSBC CFW drew to a close this evening
at the Shangri-la hotel. 5 designers showcased their collections alongside a specially
created bridal segment. A red-letter day in the Sri Lankan fashion calendar, HSBC CFW this
season presented an opportunity for designers to showcase their collections during a
socially responsible fashion week with everyone adhering to the regulations of the new
normal. A special bridle segment featured designs created by Aslan Hussein, Charini
Suriyage, Dhananjaya Bandara, FH, Lovi, Sonali Dharmawardena, Himashi Wijeweera and
Amilani Perera. Maddumage Nilusha Continuing her journey of creating zero waste patterns
that beautifully morph into dramatic designs, Nilusha's understanding of the versatility
of pattern design is admirable. Her clothes are multifunctional and can be worn in at
least two ways. Earthy tones in hues of brown and green with accent colours of dark peach
formed her colour palette. Turning his hand to drapes, Ayesh's collection showcased his
clever use of zero-waste patterns. Yards and yards of fabric were cleverly and masterfully
draped to create silhouettes that flowed very gracefully and flattered the female form.
Sonali Dharmawardene Bold graphic brushstrokes splashed across a canvas of fabric in an
assortment of sober colours formed the backdrop of this exclusive batik collection. Using
her signature abstract style of art, Sonali had also included dainty florals in her
collection. Her signature wrap skirt which she proudly claims ownership for and copied by
many dominated the collection while her sarees added a buzz to her collection. She had
also incorporated beeralu lace created by village artisans as a means of showcasing their
work through her creations. Aslam Hussein Sleek and sophisticated best describes Aslam's
design ethos. Reworking western design influences with his own design sensitivities his
dramatic silhouettes with long trains frills and ruffles added a wow factor. Canary
yellow, bubblegum pink, slate, inky blue and claret formed his colour palette. The colours
combined with his strong structured and impeccably tailored collection added visual drama
to his collection. A supporter of zero waste patterns and a follower of the waste not want
not culture Aslam follows the principles of circularity by reworking his creations into
masterpieces for the next season. Lovi Ceylon Titled ""Two Worlds"" this collection is for
those who live in two worlds. East and West. Modern and traditional. Buttoned up and
relaxed. Minimalist and adorned. Sarong and dare we say, pants. Fusing Italian design and
Sri Lankan craftsmanship, Handloom and silk with steel and gold, rooted in the LOVI sarong
silhouette—this is in fact aimed to represent the two collaborators' Asanka and Alberica's
vision - best of both worlds. Amilani Perera Charini Suriyage Dhananjaya Bandara Fouzul

life_fashion90_33_MBFW_Sri_Lanka_-_Designers_Showcase_Heritage_Crafts_With_A_M.pdf,"MBFW Sri Lanka - Designers Showcase Heritage Crafts With A Modern Spin
Dec 07 2021. Returning to Sri Lanka after a hiatus, Mercedes Benz Fashion Week to be held
at the Colombo Innovation Tower next weekend focuses on The New Local, an ambitious
marriage of local crafts and cutting edge fashion. Over three days a slew of designers,
the majority of them alumna of the AOD will be showcasing their collections. Incorporating
sustainable practices with local crafts such as bobbin lace, batik, weaving, and
embroidery this fashion show aims to highlight the endless possibilities of elevating
fashion with a Sri Lankan identity that will fit it to the global fashion arena. Jinendra
Lakmini Hewagama , a new designer opines that “Sri Lanka has a rich culture of
craftsmanship therefore it is our duty to add value to these crafts by creating cutting
edge fashion which will hold its own in the global fashion arena.” Jinendra’s collection
features handloom and batik incorporating embroidery to create fabulous fabrics and
silhouettes. Founder of Mendes Ceylon, a brand that promotes a Sri Lankan identity through
her collections Sajee Mendes has been using batik and handloom throughout. For her, The
New Local is important because she feels that Sri Lankan crafts deserve more attention.
However as a stand-alone it did not cut the grain, therefore she has elevated it by
incorporating fusion textiles which otherwise would have been destined for landfill. The
New Local also puts under the spotlight the relationship between designer and artisan.
Both working in tandem to create a garment that speaks of their individual strengths which
when joined together creates a work of art. A graduate of Moratuwa University, Harinda
Gunawardena the founder of the label Harid has incorporated techniques associated with
local handweaving practices by different communities, such as the pick-up motive technique
and the gatapismenthu technique adopted through a contemporary approach. Speaking on the
relationship he has forged with the artisans while working on his collections for The New
Local, Harinda says “In bringing this collection to life, I had the opportunity to work
closely with handweaving craft communities. Such communities practice their craft at local
levels concentrating on a home-based business model. The local artisans work with passion
and commitment to their craft while practicing great discipline. They are open to sharing
their knowledge and know-how and want the industry to prosper and continue through future
generations. Whilst actively engaging with them I have been able to get valued input and
insights into the industry and their craft practices which helped me mould my designs
while taking into consideration the history and heritage of the craft.” Deviating from the
traditional age-old crafts, designer Udaya Wickramasinghe incorporates into his collection
a relatively new craft of hand knitting along with batik. He has been working with the
hand knitting community in areas such as Kalutara, Balapitiya, Galle, Munnakkara, Chilaw,
and Negombo. His use of hand knitting techniques has helped him create surface development
and silhouette building. Of the relationship between artisan and designer, Udaya says
“Textile related local craft communities can also be defined as a knowledge-based
organization because they have their own identity, own vernacular practices, unique
techniques, social and cultural practices, indigenous knowledge, etc. these communities
show reluctance in sharing their knowledge out of their generations, where they consider
this to be a vulnerable threat to their community. The trust between the designer and the
craft community, while sharing the knowledge is very important. Thus the mutual
understanding and trust between the community and the designer are very important during
the management of the artisan knowledge. Hence a sustainable approach has to be followed
under ethical conditions in order to manage the artisan knowledge of the textile-related
local craft communities, during this collection development and promotion.” Thilini Silva
, the founder of the brand TSS has been using batik in her collections. She has the added
benefit of being able to wax and dye her fabric herself although she now has a small team
working for her as the business has grown over the years. Thilini believes that the NewLocal gives designers like her the chance to show off Sri Lankan crafts in a modern way
that entices fashion savvy. She says “the craft of batik has evolved since a few decades
ago with many designers creating modern designs using an age-old craft technique. These
modern designs are a reflection of the creative unity between designer and artisan. The
New Local will serve to highlight this and also showcase the potential of Sri Lankan
fashion. Nithya Lamahewa is another designer who has been in business since she graduated
from AOD a few years ago. Using the heritage craft of batik in her collections Nithya says
""since the pandemic there has been a positive change. People moved to slow fashion, green
design, and circular designs as they have become very conscious. In this context, The New
Local is invaluable as we can support local artisans in their livelihoods. While I also
believe that our traditional craft textiles have the power to strengthen the economy they
cannot survive by selling to the local market. We need to expand our customer base to the
world. Online shopping and exporting take our product to the world whilst giving the
purchaser a physical piece of Sri Lanka is a viable solution."" Tina Edward Gunawardhana is

Nov 10 2020. Transitioning from a teacher to a fashion designer, Najila made her entry
into the industry in 2009. Having first launched her brand KOCAbyRN (which she works on
alongside her sister Rusla) at Colombo Fashion Week in 2012 Najila has been a regular
fixture at Colombo Fashion Week. WHEN DID YOU LAUNCH YOUR BRAND? We started our brand with
LIFT - Chic fashion show in 2009 and launched with Colombo Fashion Week in 2012. WHAT
SPARKED YOUR INTEREST IN FASHION DESIGN? It was at a prominent fashion show back in 2002
called “Our Heritage” done by the JD Institute of Fashion Technology (now LIFT) where my
sister Rusla was a participating designer. I was a teacher at the time and I made the
switch. WHAT MADE YOU TAKE FASHION MORE SERIOUSLY AND MAKE A CAREER OUT OF IT? I’m not
sure that I would say I’m taking fashion more seriously now. We have a clientele that is
interested in our perspective of fashion and I enjoy the work that I do more than anything
else. ARE YOU SELF TAUGHT OR DID YOU STUDY FASHION DESIGN? I’m an alumnus of LIFT which is
affiliated with the University of Northhampton in the UK. I further refreshed my knowledge
related to the industry with “Singapore workforce skills qualifications” in Singapore in
2019. HOW HAS YOUR WORK EVOLVED SINCE YOU BEGAN YOUR OWN LABEL? We started our collections
with appliqués made on simple viscose materials. Today we have ventured into using all
kinds of textures incorporating beautiful art, embroidery and prints. We also have grown
to be more conscious of our environment and its people while we work. ARE THERE ANY TYPES
OF CLOTHING THAT YOU AVOID DESIGNING? We don’t focus on swimwear. Besides swimwear, we
cater to all other silhouettes and types of styles for women. WHERE DO YOU LOOK FOR
CREATIVE INSPIRATION? I look to life experiences both good and bad to ignite inspiration
for me. It may not necessarily translate into fashion automatically but it plays a role in
how it is created. Almost anything can help creative inspiration if you are tuned into it.
DESCRIBE YOUR LATEST COLLECTION? The latest collection is about three personalities of
women. It translates to nature/wildlife and architecture. WHAT ARE YOUR SUSTAINABILITY
CREDENTIALS? Woman empowerment Uplifting and working with SMEs / HBBs in Sri Lanka &
overseas. Zero waste. Minimise water pollution by using eco-printing techniques. Practice
initiatives like Reuse Restyle & Upcycle concepts like “six yards of upcycle”. We make an
active effort towards reducing our carbon footprint in our process and try our best to do
as we can towards sustainability. WHAT ARE YOU FASCINATED BY AT THE MOMENT AND HOW DOES IT
FEED INTO YOUR WORK? I’m fascinated by underwater life and bird watching at the moment.
WHAT IS THE BIGGEST LESSON THAT YOU HAVE LEARNED SINCE YOU STARTED YOUR COMPANY? As a
creative entrepreneur, I would say that there are always lessons to learn. It is a
constant learning process but a big learning for me would be to work alongside other SMEs
that I could trust and are the right group of individuals to liaise with. WHAT IS YOUR
FAVOURITE PART ABOUT BEING A DESIGNER? It’s the process before a launch of a new
collection and having the opportunity to collaborate with like-minded individuals. HOW DO
YOU WANT WOMEN TO FEEL WHEN WEARING YOUR CLOTHES? Clothing in itself to me is an art form.
It is not defined or limited to a particular type of texture or way of creating and is
more about a feeling that an individual gets when adorned in the attire. Be it an
understated elegance or exuberance, we try to create it (sustainably) for the wearer in
the most simplistic and innovative of ways. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_3_AARYA_BY_INDI_Hits_The_Runway.pdf,"‘AARYA BY INDI’ Hits The Runway
Nov 17 2022. Leading couture designer Indi Yapa Abeywardena is set to take over the runway
on 18 November 2022 at the Colombo Town Hall Building with her Spring-Summer 2023
collection ‘Aarya by Indi’. Announcing her debut solo fashion show at a press conference
held at Cinnamon Lakeside Colombo, Indi shared that the show has been in the making for
over four years and the collection is one that is very close to her heart. The collection
is named ‘Aarya’ after Indi’s niece with particular significance placed on its reference
to goddess Parvati and Durga given that the pieces are heavily influenced by the ancient
history of Sri Lanka and India. “The collection was inspired by the romantic and political
meeting of Vijaya and Kuweni and the connection between India and Sri Lanka throughout
history. It embodies a sense of heritage and translates the past to the present through
design.” The collection will feature statement pieces carrying Indi’s signature eye for
detail through hand-drawn prints and handcrafted textures. With a focus on sustainability
and culture, Aarya by Indi places Sri Lanka’s heritage crafts of beeralu and cane in the
spotlight though its designs. Indi shared that the collection has over 50 styles ranging
from bridal and ethnic wear to western wear like dresses, jumpsuits, and sarees adding
that she is still working on a piece she hopes would be the ‘showstopper’ of the evening.
As a young female entrepreneur, Indi shared her excitement of putting together a solo
fashion show through her brand House of Indi and having the runway at an iconic venue like
the Colombo Town Hall. She hopes the show will put Sri Lanka on the global map as a design
destination and fashion hub and also inspire young designers, especially women, to
challenge themselves in the fashion and design industry. On an ending note, Indi expressed
her gratitude to everyone that is making the show possible, especially her team behind the
scenes who are the pillars of her brand House of Indi. “My girls and I have been working
tirelessly to make this show happen, it’s been a dream of ours for over 4 years and I hope
to deliver a show that will leave everyone surprised.” The launch of the Aarya by Indi
collection at the Colombo Town Hall will be followed by an afterparty at SEQUEL by
Cinnamon Grand. As official hospitality partners of the show, Area VP Operations for
Cinnamon Hotels and Resorts Colombo, Kamal Munasinghe shared that Indi is a perfect fit
for the brand’s ethos of supporting local industries and entreprenuers and promises
something old with a little bit of something new at the after-party, “An experience where
music meets theatricts and a good time to remember”. Christell Skin Clinic, a leading
cosmetology clinic in Sri Lanka is the main sponsor of the event. Co-Founder of the
clinic, Dr. Shanika Arsecularatne commented that their support for Indi’s show was a no-
brainer; adding that the brand is a patron of strong female entreprenuers such as Indi who
has revolutionized bridal wear in Sri Lanka. The Aarya by Indi collection is joined by
Aroma Bliss Ceylon, Sri Lankan Airlines, Chariot Bakery and Restaurant, Brian Kerkoven
Academy, Capello Salons, Beyond Destiny, Nierra Shoes, Gitano Collection, Lè Floristè,
Wine World and Haut Monde Event Management as sponsors and partners for the show. Pictures

life_fashion90_3_Designer_1-2-1_Twinkle_Goonethilleke.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Twinkle Goonethilleke
Oct 12 2021. Designer Twinkle Goonethilleke was scheduled to launch THE HIGHNESS - Journey
of a Dress in December 2021 in France at the Paris American Academy where she had worked
as an intern and gained experience at Paris Fashion Week. However, with the numerous
lockdowns, this did not materialize and has now been rescheduled to December 2021.
Recently Twinkle designed her own dress for the final crown shoot of Miss
Intercontinental. What sparked your interest in fashion design? I’m very good at art and
sketching. It’s my born talent. My mother observed my talents and urged me to take part in
a fashion designing competition by Mrs. Chula Nanayakkara Ariyarathne. I sent my own
designs as per the given criteria, such as Eveningwear, Office wear, Casual wear, and
Saree wear. I was the youngest contestant among 200 contestants and I was selected for the
finals and became the youngest Fashion Designer of the Year in 2007. What made you take
fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? After I was awarded the Fashion
Designer in the year 2007 at the age of 11, I thought to myself, this is my path as a
career to be chosen in the future. I received a lot of press attention after the win, but
due to the strict rules of my Alma Mater Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo I was not able to
further this ambition until I left school. I realised fashion design is a good choice and
it is a lucrative career. Are you self-taught or did you study fashion design? I am self-
taught. I joined the Women’s State University Bangalore in India where I graduated as a
qualified fashion designer. Thereafter, my university sent me to Paris American Academy,
France for my internship. During my stay in Paris, I gained fashion experience at Paris
Fashion Week. Also, I got an opportunity to study under the renowned famous fashion
designer Manish Arora. How has your work evolved since you began your own label? For the
launch of my label, I aim to target the local market and Mumbai and Paris. In Sri Lanka,
my focus is on a ready to wear and wrap dress collection while in Mumbai and Paris I will
focus on colourful fabrics in traditional silhouettes and Haute Couture adding my personal
flair to the designs. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? Basically,
I avoid designing too loose clothes, trousers, coarse-looking dresses, jumpsuits and
cardigans. Where do you look for creative inspiration? I always look up to 90s style
celebrities like Cindy Crawford, Victoria Beckham, DVF, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer.
My creative inspiration is derived from vintage and contemporary fashion, rich heritage,
print and colour. Who is your muse? My muse is my mother. She is my all-time inspiration
and fashionista since childhood. I always see the way she dresses up for work very
glamorously. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your
company? When I started doing designing and my own range, you should not release anything
or discuss it with anyone until it comes to a conclusion. Also not to share your
uniqueness with others or else it’s difficult to make your own market. What’s your motto?
“If you believe - You can achieve.” What role do you think social media plays in fashion
today? In the fashion industry, social media platforms are used to interact with the
consumer as a means of networking with others in the industry. Social media influence
designers in unique ways that are changing the way many designers create their fashions.
It has also proven to give more exposure to individual brands. How do you want women to
feel when wearing your clothes? I want them to feel confident, empowered, the highness,
proud and sophisticated women in charge. Pix Courtesy : Twinkle Tina Edward Gunawardhana

life_fashion90_3_Fashionably_Danu_-_Kingsman_Studio.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu - Kingsman Studio
Mar 28 2018. Today for Fashionably Danu, we went back to an old English town evoking
exquisitely crafted suits from 17th-century British royalty and brought out through a
contemporary look at Kingsman. Kingsman is a brand that triggers the nostalgia of the
sartorial British revolution of suits for the modern gentleman. From the time I walked in,
it was a unique suiting experience that meticulously aligns to your individual
requirements. Each suit is crafted gradually through a process of consulting, measuring,
fabric selection, sewing and trials. The young man who is the brainchild for this brand is
Abdullah Aslam who is soft spoken but has a sharp eye for fine details, he has a varied
background ranging from Economics to Management to E-commerce, which culminated in the
Kingsman Studio on 28/10/2017. 5 months to the day they opened, I take a look at the
quintessential gentleman’s brand: ‘The Kingsman’. 1. Is the name inspired by the movie
Kingsman? Yes to an extent it is. The movie was shot in one of the most renowned Savile
Row Tailors in the world and the suits they had crafted for the movie inspired me.
Additionally, I wanted a name that would easily resonate with Suits, British and the
essence of a Gentleman. The brand Kingsman now triggers the nostalgia of the sartorial
British revolution of suits for the modern gentleman. 2. What made you take up men's wear,
as many don’t make it their number one choice? I am passionate about men’s fashion and Sri
Lanka has minimal options available for men. I personally feel that not enough is being
done in educating men on personal style and fashion. 3. What are the looks you have
featured on me today? The five looks we have today are paired with accessories from
www.ajsrilanka.com to really blend your personal style and the sartorial elements of
British suits. Burgundy Peak Lapel Suit with a ticket pocket and Decorative Stitch for
extra detail along with white shirt, a blue floral tie and gold reindeer lapel pin. To
further personalise it, your name has been monogrammed inside the suit jacket with grey
paisley lining. We have also given you a grey buttonhole contrast on your left jacket
sleeve, which is a sign of a personalised suit. Burgundy Jacket mixed and matched with a
grey small-checked pants along with a black shirt and black pocket square for a casual
look. Beige Checked Notch Lapel Jacket mixed and matched with Royal Blue pants along with
a sky blue shirt and a royal blue suede tie. The checked pattern has been inverted on the
pocket flaps as a twist on the jacket. The jacket has been personalised with a monogram of
your initials with blue paisley lining. Classic Shawl Lapel Double Breasted Royal Blue
Waist Coat with matching pants. Brown small checked pants with a side tab and a coin
pocket paired with a white shirt. 4. The cut is what makes a suit stand out, how do you
ensure that Kingsman gets the perfect fit? At Kingsman Studio, we give our clients a
suiting experience, which consists of four aspects that helps us achieve the perfect fit
for every deserving gentleman : Precise measurements by our experienced Master Cutter
Construction of Custom Pattern Blocks for every client instead of using standard pattern
blocks Superior Fusing fabric sourced to ensure better fit and longevity Personal
attention, multiple fittings and consultation sessions to get it right 5. How would you
describe your personal style? I am into timeless classics. My go-to-look is a crisp white
rolled up shirt with navy blue formal pants paired with a tan brown leather belt, tan
brown oxfords and a brown Daniel Wellington dress watch. I also have an obsession with
checked fabrics, which is back in style. With regards to suits, my signature style is a
Peak Lapel checked suit with a decorative stitch for extra detail and a buttonhole
contrast. 6. What are the customizable features that you provide? Apart from standard
customizable options such as fit, lapel types, lapel size, vents, pocket types and angle,
buttons and wide range of linings to choose from, we also offer: Complimentary monogram of
your initials inside every suit jacket. Option to get your full name or a phrase
embroidered instead of your initials also available as an extra option. ComplimentaryButtonhole contrasts for a personalised touch. The first buttonhole on the left jacket
sleeve can be contrasted. Decorative stitch: a hand sewn stitch which runs across the
entire suit for added detail. Functional Buttons/Surgeon’s Cuff: Jacket cuffs with
functioning buttons so the cuffs can be unbuttoned and rolled back like shirt sleeves.
This is a sign of a carefully crafted high-end suit. Pants with a side tab instead of belt
loops, which is a classic touch. 7. Your showroom has a unique look and feel to it, what
made you design it like this? Having been inspired by British Vintage architecture and my
love for antiques led me to this design. One of my best friend’s, Sarala Perera who is an
architect helped me execute my vision. 8. What according to you is your favourite part of
being in this industry? Every suit we craft is different and that’s what makes it
exciting. 9. Why should a gentleman pick you for his suit? Apart from providing a unique
suiting experience environment we are convinced that a tailored suit is an investment. We
at Kingsman Studio are obsessive about attention to detail and craftsmanship so we ensure
that you get a quality suit for your investment. Every Kingsman suit or pants that is
stitched undergoes a strict quality process. Additionally, each suit that leaves our
studio is unique in its own way and reflects the wearer’s personality through the unique
customization options we offer. We take time to work on your suits and pride ourselves in
that. 10. What is the process of creating a suit? First , we start off with a one on one
consultation session where different suit styles, customization options and the different
fabrics available are explored. Styles are then recommended based on which best suit, your
body type, and occasion. Once the style options have been confirmed we move on to the
measurement phase with the master cutter. Precise measurements are taken and the posture
is assessed taking into consideration any unique requirements of clients. After the master
cutter has everything he requires, a custom pattern paper block is constructed for the
body type. Thereafter fabric is cut and preparations are made for the baste fitting at
which we can see the overall fit and silhouette as the fabric is loosely held together
with basting thread. Adjustments are made if any and a final fitting is scheduled. The
suit is then delivered at the final fitting unless a further alteration is required.

life_fashion90_3_Kaftan_Cool.pdf,"Kaftan Cool!
Apr 24 2017. As the heat intensifies with no signs of abating ask any seasoned fashionista
what she turns to on those scorching days and chances are that a kaftan forms the basis of
her covetable attire. No longer relegated to the ""auntie"" fashion realm, it's the one item
of clothing that doesn't require you to be tall, thin or look like a clothes horse. Cool
and loose in the heat, and yet chic and original, get it right, goes the thinking, and you
could be laughing from the pool to the beach, all through lunch, possibly even out to
dinner with the right heels. On social media, a stream of style influencers - Beyonce,
Rihanna, Poppy Delevingne and more - have done much to popularize the kaftan, heralding it
as an indispensable item! The kaftan is currently being embraced with a fervour not
witnessed since Yves Saint Laurent and Talitha Getty popularized it into mainstream
fashion in the sixties! Yves Saint Laurent and his life partner, Pierre Bergé, who
launched the Saint Laurent fashion house with him in 1961, visited Marrakesh, Morocco, in
1968, and became enamored with the colours, textiles, and sensuality of Moroccan culture.
Saint Laurent fashioned kaftans for his fabulous pals like actress and socialite Talitha
Getty, her playboy husband, John Paul Getty, Jr. In January 1969, the Gettys were
photographed by Patrick Lichfield wearing kaftans on a Marrakech rooftop, which became an
iconic image that defined what’s known as hippie or boho chic. A symbol of exoticism and a
bohemian lifestyle, over the years ""kaftan"" has become the catchall term in fashion for
any kind of loose-fitting robe or tunic - often used to describe a number of different
garments of Middle Eastern and North African origination. Kaftan is a Persian word, while
the garment style is believed to have originated in Ancient Mesopotamia. The Ottoman
sultans from the 14th to the 18th centuries wore lavishly decorated kaftans; they were
also given as rewards to important dignitaries and generals. It can be made from almost
any fabric; most are made of silk, wool, or cotton and are often bound with a sash.
Kaftans are worn by both men and women in variations across the Iranian plateau, through
North Africa, and into West Africa. Primarily worn in hot climates, the kaftan’s loose
silhouette helps proper ventilation, therefore lowering the body temperature (though
Russians have a similar garment also called a kaftan made of fur). When the Western world
(including England, France, Italy, and the United States) started to appropriate kaftans
in the 20th century, the idea was pilfered from all over the map. Kaftan fashion in the
West was borne out of a romantic obsession with the idea of the exotic otherness, whether
it was fantasies about Arabian deserts, Indian temples, Turkish palaces, or Southeast
Asian islands. In Europe and North America, authentic kaftans were rarely worn other than
by an elite few travellers who brought them back from exotic expeditions as part of the
fad for Orientalism and Turkish style interiors during the 19th century. It was not until
the 1950s and early 1960s they appeared in high fashion when adapted by French couturiers.
Dior is credited with showing the first modern kaftan, as a coat over a dress, on a haute
couture runway in the 1950s. By 1967, Vreeland’s ""Vogue"" was filled with gorgeous models
in kaftans in exotic locations. She insisted that kaftans were ""fashionable for the
beautiful people. For the Dancing Queens who loved disco, it was the height of fashion to
have something that you could dance in that showed off your motion by moving with you"".
The kaftan lent itself well to the fashions of the next decade; providing a simple
silhouette that could be beaded, heavily patterned, or sleekly minimal as seen in the
designs of Halston in the 1970s, loved by the Studio 54 set! Celebrities like Jackie
Kennedy, Bianca Jagger, Elizabeth Taylor, Brigitte Bardot, and Grace Kelly were
photographed in designer kaftans. It mostly stemmed from its association with exoticism as
well as the easy-to-wear comfort of these pieces. From the mid-1970s through to the last
decade, the kaftan disappeared from most high fashion catwalks, instead becoming
associated with resort wear. While kaftans were for the young and sexy in the disco world,as soon as disco became passé, kaftans, along with muumuus, were regaled to batty old
ladies! Instead, young starlets in the 1980s adopted form-fitting Spandex and big, angular
shoulder pads. The '80s introduced a more body-conscious fashion and the silhouette just
changed dramatically, where you had an emphasis on the shoulders and big hair. The early
'90s saw a return of the bold and graphic silhouette of the kaftan, it’s a garment that
enables designers to each put their unique spin on it, while usually maintaining the ease
of comfort and modesty that make it so appealing to women worldwide. Shortened to micro-
mini length, Tom Ford took the kaftan silhouette to the realm of the erotic for Gucci
Spring 1996, as designers seeking to inject their collections with an ""oriental"" touch and
nostalgia for the 1960s rediscovered the versatility of this garment. Fashion designers
such as Pucci, Missoni, Temperley and Dolce & Gabbana have continually reanimated the
kaftan’s Bohemian mystique, and others such as red carpet favourite Elie Saab have brought
the kaftan to the red carpet with ornately beaded and embroidered versions. The kaftan is
something that you can wear comfortably in a few different settings. It allows you to wear
really comfortable clothing in public, things that you might have reserved for just
wearing behind closed doors in your own house. The unstructured garment is really
appealing to people in as something that can be transformed in so many ways. You can dress
it up, dress it down. It can be casual, for heading to the beach or hanging out at home,
but it’s still something that people can wear outside and feel fashionable in. There are
not that many garments that translate so well. Kaftans have an ambiguous sexuality to
them, they can both free the body and emphasize the body, while still remaining somewhat
dignified. Colombo fashion favourites like Buddhi Batiks do a range of stunning kaftans
with their signature batik in chiffons, cottons and satins, while AISH available at PR,
made from the softest muslins and second skin cottons are incredibly wearable as are the
vibrant block printed long and short kaftans from Anohki available at MILK on Horton
Place. For online shopping, Fashion Market is always a great source! Your comment (*)",6601

Jun 30 2017. Colombo’s annual swimsuit mecca witnessed both local and international
designers showcase their collections to a fashion savvy audience. Thanks to the vision of
Ajai Vir Singh, Sri Lankan designers especially have been encouraged to launch their swim
collections in the recent past and what better place to hold Asia’s first dedicated annual
Swim Week than in Sri Lanka, a tropical paradise. This year, Swim Week Colombo introduced
their all new global positioning with their theme ‘Green Conscious and Earth Sensitive’
and in lieu of this, all designers taking the ramp had to ensure their collections were in
par with this new sustainable fashion theme. Kicking off Swim Week, 8 designers took to
the ramp showcasing a multitude of swim, resort and active wear featuring clean cuts,
flirty tassels and sleek silhouettes while staying true to the season’s theme of green
consciousness Inspired by stars and constellations, La Pard’s collection comprised of
bikinis, one pieces, swim shorts and crop tops using accent colours of magenta, orange and
brown. Her resort wear pieces were long flowy dresses in silk and chiffon which can be
dressed up or down. Dinushi used her signature style of batik in her creations. Models
stomped down the runway in a military inspired swimwear collection. Sharmilla Ruberu the
designer behind Meraki, presented a collection in military colours of olive, brown and
navy with accent colours of red plum. Her bikinis, bandeaus and one piece swimwear were
both daring and edgy with a nuance of attitude. Just like its designer Annika Fernando,
this collection by Maus was sophisticated and stylish. A largely monochrome collection
with pops of red made this collection exquisite. Marshalling the batik expertise of Sonali
Dharmawardne, Annika created some intricate batik patterned maxi style dresses which lent
a classic and timeless elegance to her collection. Funky sandals added to the sleek look.
Her collection combined high end style with impeccable quality. Classic flattering lines
and chic monochrome added to this brand’s sun soaked holiday in the tropics vibe!
Rachel Raj A brand that offers luxury ready to wear, freesize clothing, Rachel Raj is
designed and made in Sri Lanka. Using the crane flower as her inspiration, Sarita
Rajendra, the designer behind the brand showcased a collection of swim and resort wear
which was sassy, sexy and sophisticated. Her gold hued swimwear evoked memories of a
bygone era. The whole collection had a retro feel to it with evolving memories of the 70’s
classic disco era. Siblings Rusla and Najila presented a collection of resort wear which
was dominated by prints designed by themselves. Reds, greens, and oranges inspired by the
Josean colour palette made this an interesting collection. Flowly silhouettes with obi
belts, dramatic collars and billowing sleeves which lent itself to the Koca design
aesthetic were sent down the runway in dramatic style. Keeping in line with their style
ethos Rum Punch bought colour and energy onto the ramp with their swimwear collection.
Featuring geometric prints in bright colours this collection certainly packed a punch!
This exotic collection focused on swimwear and activewear along with beach accessories
embodying the island spirit. Capturing the essence of East Coast Sri Lanka, the collection
by arugambay takes a pun on Aztec with its use of prints. With blue and green dominantly
used throughout the collection, it plays tribute to surf philosophy and the marine
environment. Hot As Hell Paradis Trouvé by HAH was inspired by Mother Earth. With a rich
colour palette of blood red, green, brown and cream the collection stayed true to the
brand’s roots in natural, ethical products for women. With stunning silhouettes, bikinis
and one piece swimwear in hand drawn prints HAH presented a show stopping line up at Swim
Week Colombo. Check out our facebook album of Day 1. Your comment (*)",3982
life_fashion90_3_The_Trendy_Tie-_Dye_Comeback.pdf,"The Trendy Tie- Dye Comeback
Jun 24 2019. The Tie-Dye trend is officially back ladies and gentlemen and that too with a
bold and stylish avatar. Back in the day, tie-dye was just an amusing experiment, an
exciting way of throwing t-shirts and denims into a bucket of your favourite dye in the
lawn, to come up with cool patterns with your buddies. In the early 80’s and 90’s when
Drew Barrymore was every young girl's idol and the hit television series ‘Clueless’ was
every teenager's virtual reality, baggy tie-dye t-shirts, denim jackets and jeans were an
essential part of every teenager’s closet. Today’s tie-dye is much more versatile. Both on
the runway and amongst the celebrities, tie-dye has made a surprising comeback and seems
to be taking up the role of a wardrobe staple. Fashion powerhouse Prada showcased clothes
with a modern take on tie-dye with bright colours coupled with elevated fabrics and
patterns, to give it a chic look. The fashion police went crazy over Beyoncé’s sexy tie
dye orange, pink and white mini dress. Contrary, to the time where tie-dye was a style
movement owned by the hippies, tie-dye today has made appearances in prestigious events
like the Met Gala. Lupita Nyongo’s custom made pink dress with rainbow-hued tie dye ruffle
shoulders from Versace Atelier, turned heads at the red carpet and made for an instant hit
amongst the fashion critics. Top brands like Young, Fabulous and Broke showcases tie-dye
as a multifaceted arrangement for summer jumpsuits and evening dresses that are perfect
for a night out with your girlfriends. Lacoste’s Short Ripstop Down Jacket for men looks
like goals on a chilly day. If there is one thing we’ve learnt this season, it is that
tie-dye can be incorporated into anything. If you still haven’t joined the rest of the
world in ushering in the tie-dye comeback, you still can. Be it a casual pastel-coloured
tie-dye t-shirt with denim shorts for a day out, a satin tie-dye party dress for the
evening or even a neon green tie-dye bag to go with your monochrome outfits, you are sure
to spice up your fashion game. Back at home, we have got our own tie dye game going
strong. Especially, because we pair it with another more native pattern making process
like Batik. The combination of tie-dye and batik has been a constant fashion statement for
us Lankans because it represents who we are. It is amazing how both batik and tie-dye can
be mixed together to produce a quirky, fun and individualistic flair, that spells out pure
Sri Lankan authenticity and vogue in every piece. Now more than ever, we see various local
labels portraying fashion lines with a variety of clothing styles, which are inspired by
our focus on tie-dye with a twist of batik, attracting the attention of both the local and
international crowds in Colombo all year around. It’s not just batik sarees or tie-dye
sarongs anymore, this bubbly and evergreen trend is taking over everything from clothes to
bags to shoes to even scrunchies and hair bands. The coolest way to slay in your outfits
this season is to give into the batik and tie-dye culture of our nation and go all out!
After all who can say no to all that colour? Tie-dye jumpsuits, rompers and dresses are
one of the funkiest ways to own this trend. Pair them with colourful accessories and a
neutral coloured tote bag and you are good to go. Homegrown brand ‘Salt’ does spunky
bright coloured palazzo jumpsuits and summer dresses that look perfect for the season. If
you want to stay true to the classic tie dye statement then you can never go wrong with a
vibrant tie-dye t-shirt or shirt and a pair of your favourite jeans. If you are in the
mood for something relaxed and comfortable but with a twist of batik then ‘Swanee’
showcases dreamy tie-dye and batik shirt dresses, cotton sarees and kaftans. ‘Buddhi
Batiks’ is the ideal place for a bride looking to wear a unique bridal saree. Their
quintessential bridal sarees portrays the enchanting amalgamation of culture, panache and
elegance on luxurious fabrics. Their handcrafted clutches with one of a kind tie dye and
batik patterns have even made it to the Met Gala 2019 as a bespoke accessory to Livia
Firth’s ensemble. Your comment (*)",4208

that honours this legacy by dressing every man in the celebration, from the page boy to
the groom, father, and grandfather. It’s about making sure each person plays their part in
style and feels proud to be part of the moment. 2-What makes The Wedding Chapter stand out
from other groomswear offerings in Sri Lanka? This isn’t just about clothing—it’s about
the complete experience. We provide a total Groomswear Solution, which includes
personalised consultations, Made to Order, Made to Measure, and full Bespoke tailoring.
Our customers can choose from over 300 fabric options, including world-class suiting
fabrics from mills like Loro Piana, Zegna, Vitale Barberis Canonico, Dormeuil, and many
more. We also extend into grooming, wellness, and lifestyle, ensuring the groom feels and
looks his best on his big day. 3-Can you tell us more about the kind of weddings and
styles you cater to? Absolutely. We understand that weddings today come in many
forms—Western, Indo-Western, ethnic, destination weddings, or modern-national themes. With
The Wedding Chapter, we offer full customisation to suit the theme, complete with
personalised styling and accessories. It’s about ensuring the groom shines just as much as
the bride. 4-You mentioned grooming and wellness. How does that fit into the package?
Style is not only about what you wear—it’s also about how you feel. That’s why we’ve
partnered with trusted service providers to give grooms a holistic experience. We offer
grooming by The Real Barber, skincare and wellness through Christell Clinic, fitness
programs with Revolución Leisure Hub, and even meal plans to help the groom feel his
absolute best. It’s a one-stop solution that takes care of everything. 5-What role do
partnerships play in enhancing The Wedding Chapter experience? We’ve brought together a
group of leading partners to make the journey seamless and memorable. For example, the
Galle Face Hotel is our official hotel partner, Malkey Rent A Car provides premium
transportation, and our other partners add value in health, fitness, and grooming.
Together, we create a complete ecosystem around the groom and his entourage. 6-CSR has
always been close to Hameedia’s heart. Is there a social element in this launch? Yes, we
are gifting three deserving grooms full suits for their weddings. It’s our way of giving
back and making sure that every man, no matter his circumstances, gets his moment to
shine. We invite people to nominate someone they believe truly deserves this gift by
calling 076 865 2468 or emailing wearefamily@hameedia.com 7-Where can customers access The
Wedding Chapter packages? Exclusive groom collections are available at Envoy Mansion and
our Hameedia Wellawatte store. But all our outlets across the island cater to complete
wedding requirements. Customers can also book personalised consultations in Colombo,
Kurunegala, Kandy, and Negombo—or even arrange a VIP consultation via WhatsApp. 8-
Finally, what is your vision for The Wedding Chapter? Our vision is simple—to make every
groom feel celebrated. A wedding is the beginning of a new chapter, but it is also a
continuation of a family’s legacy. With The Wedding Chapter, we honour that by ensuring
each man, across three generations, looks and feels his very best as they step into thismilestone together. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel,

Sep 14 2021. Adding another feather to his cap, London based Sri Lankan fashion designer
Amesh Wijesekera has been named as the inaugural winner of the Reference Incubator
Programme. As reported in Business of Fashion, the fashion industry’s news provider, Amesh
will receive mentorship and support from cult retailer Slam Jam as well as PR and brand
consulting services from communications agency reference Studios. The Incubator Programme
was launched as part of the Reference Festival which is a biannual event that runs as part
of the prestigious Berlin Fashion Week. Amesh who travels between Sri Lanka and the UK is
one of the few designers who has enjoyed unprecedented success since he graduated from the
AOD. His eponymous label Amesh is high on sustainability. Using local artisans, Amesh’s
collections are gender fluid. His use of bright colours injects a breath of fresh air and
exoticism to the European catwalks which make his collections eye-catching. Speaking to
Life.lk Amesh says “This win is something I have been waiting for and it is the perfect
time for the brand’s growth! I am elated to be a part of the incubator programme with
industry pioneers such as Reference Studios and Slam Jam. Understanding the fashion
business as a market is something I have been struggling with and I know this win will
enable me to take the brand to new heights. In return, I hope I am able to provide more
opportunities for our Sri Lankan artisans who form the backbone of the craft and apparel
industries. I do hope there will be opportunities for all of us who are striving to
promote the beautiful heritage crafts of our artisans.” The Incubator Programme is an
exciting new platform for growing emerging labels by providing various services. This will
also help Amesh overcome the challenges of operating independently in complex and
competitive markets. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel,

life_fashion90_4_Buzz_with_Danu_-_Sammani_Pathiranagama.pdf,"Buzz with Danu - Sammani Pathiranagama
Mar 06 2024. Today on the Buzz I speak to the young lady who added the extra flair to
men’s fashion in Sri Lanka. It’s been 10 years since her brand olive-couture and there is
a show to celebrate it. I spoke to her about her 10-year journey. 1. How has the last 10
years been in building this brand? It has been a challenging yet enjoyable decade indeed.
It's amazing to stand where we are now and reflect on all the hard work that went into
building the brand Olive Couture and I am humbled by its success. Over the last 10 years,
Olive Couture has experienced significant growth and success, establishing itself as a
reputable brand in the fashion industry. Olive Couture has expanded its product line,
increased its customer base, and entered new markets. Additionally, Olive Couture has
focused on enhancing its brand identity, and marketing strategies to stay competitive in
this evolving industry. 2. When you were qualifying in fashion in Australia, you took a
risk in working on menswear and bringing that knowledge to Sri Lanka did you think Sri
Lankan men were ready to be a bit edgy? When studying fashion in Australia and bringing
that expertise to Sri Lanka, I believed there was potential for Sri Lankan men to embrace
edgier styles. However, it was a calculated risk based on market research, understanding
consumer preferences, and recognizing the evolving fashion trends in Sri Lanka. The aim
was to offer something fresh and appealing to the market while also staying attuned to
local tastes and cultural sensitivities. Starting off Olive Couture as a menswear brand
was the best decision at that time as it was a forgotten and neglected market segment that
needed the attention that it deserved. 3. Your brand has evolved into casual and even
bridal, what would you say is your unique style in bridal? Yes as I mentioned earlier
during the last decade we worked on expanding our product lines, as a result, we launched
SAMANI by Olive Couture for off-the-rack casual wear and Olive Bridal Couture for bridals.
My style in Bridal is more sophisticated, minimalistic and timeless. I love experimenting
with cuts and materials. 4. That’s going to be a massive show. I’m told celebrating your
brand and it’s 10 years tell me about the show and what can we expect? Yes, as exciting as
it sounds I am hosting a lavish fashion show to celebrate the journey of 10 years in
business. The show will be an invitees-only exclusive event attended by over 400
individuals which includes industry leaders, influencers, VIPs, celebrities, and fashion
enthusiasts alike. The show is set to take place on the 16th of March 2024 at the Airforce
Museum, Rathmalana and I am planning to showcase 4 different collections under 4 exciting
themes. It's a huge production and everything is all set for a one-of-a-kind experience.
5. You have even made clothes for Ambani's wedding, and your clients have always been so
loyal. What is your secret formula? Yes! Our cricket legend Mahela Jayawardena is one of
my most loyal and respected clients and he recently got two bespoke outfits for Anant
Ambani & Radhika’s wedding and we were able to create something that reflects his
identity. Our secret formula for maintaining loyal clients, including prestigious ones,
lies in our unwavering commitment to quality, and innovation. By consistently delivering
exceptional craftsmanship, attention to detail, and a seamless customer experience, we
have fostered trust and loyalty among our clientele over the years. Happy to say that our
clients' loyalty is the biggest wealth we have as a brand. 6. You have dressed some of the
most influential men in our country how do you make them see beyond a black or blue? Yes,
I think I was successful in doing that and getting them to step out of their comfort
zones. I focus on showcasing alternative colour options that complement their skin tone
and personality, while also emphasizing the importance of fit, fabric, and style details
to make a statement without sacrificing professionalism. Additionally, I encourage
experimenting with different patterns, textures, and accessories to add personality and
distinction to their attire. 7. What is your personal opinion about Fashion in Sri Lanka?
It stands at a far better place than before and we do have a fashion-conscious client baseand it's easier to make clothes for them when they are updated with trends. Happy that the
Sri Lankan fashion scene is evolving with a lot of emerging brands coming into play as
well. 8. Tell me about the design process for your collection this year. So the 4
collections will be Ready to Wear, Bridal, Indian and Red Carpet. The themes I will reveal
at the show. The 4 collections will collectively have 80 looks of men’s and women’s wear.
The whole process of designing and researching started last year and we have put a lot of
effort and thought into creating these garments, culminating in creativity, craftsmanship
and attention to detail... I sourced most of the materials from overseas and handpicked
most of the fabrics when I travelled overseas. My fabulous staff and I worked tirelessly
on this collection and we can't wait to showcase them on the ramp. 9. You have always
believed in minimalistic designs. Has this been a hard sell to us Lankans? Promoting
minimalistic designs in Sri Lanka can sometimes be challenging due to the cultural
preference for vibrant colours, intricate patterns, and embellishments. However, there is
a growing appreciation for minimalism globally, including in Sri Lanka, as people
recognize its elegance, versatility, and timeless appeal. By emphasizing the quality,
functionality, and understated sophistication of minimalistic designs, it's possible to
gradually influence tastes and preferences in the local fashion scene. 10. After the show
kicks off on the ramp, where can we expect to see these clothing and would they be up for
sale immediately? Are there any facilities for us to pre-book some of these looks? Yes,
the whole collection will be up for sale as one-off exclusive pieces and will be available
to purchase at the Olive Couture studio at 22, Deanston Place, Colombo 03. And yes you can
prebook your favorite look on the day. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a Marketing qualification

life_fashion90_4_Designer_1-2-1_Shamindri_Ranasinghe.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Shamindri Ranasinghe
Sep 08 2020. Inspired by fashion icons of the 60s such as The Beatles, Twiggy, Jane Fonda
and Marianne Faithful, Shamindri Ranasinghe a graduate of the AOD has used a mix of sheer
and solid fabrics to create a collection which will bring out the inner confidence in
women. Spotted by a reputed stylist, one of Senuri’s designs worn by Sonali Silva featured
in the June issue of Hi!! magazine. What inspired the pieces you created? The
‘subtiléélégance’ spring and summer 2020 women’s wear collection was inspired by men’s
tailoring and women’s wear from the 1960s. My collection began with the exploration of
tailoring techniques while aligning my passion for pattern making. In addition to this, my
designs were also heavily influenced by fashion icons of that era such as The Beatles,
Twiggy, Jane Fonda and Marianne Faithful. My whole idea of mixing synthetic fabrics with
sheer transparent fabrics was to bring out that inner confidence in women because sheer
cloth does not hide your body from view. I was aimed to create well-tailored looks to
encourage the youth and to empower women in society which inspired me when creating this
collection. Who is your muse? Dame Lesley Lawson who was an English model, actress, and
singer, widely known by the nickname Twiggy. She was a British cultural icon and a
prominent teenage model during the swinging sixties in London. She was a boss lady who was
very ambitious, which is why I have chosen her as the muse for this collection. What are
your sustainability credentials? I have implemented the upcycled method of taking old,
worn out and slightly damaged materials and transforming them into brand new pieces. How
has your Feminine Identity been portrayed through this collection? If I were to describe
my sense of Fashion, I would describe it as classic, chic and elegant. Something that I’m
very keen on when it comes to Fashion is that ‘attention to detail.’ I believe my
collection is a perfect combination of all of the above. My idea is contrary to popular
cultural ideas of femininity where I’m trying to basically empower women. Instead, I’m
challenging conventional femininity. I believe women can wear good suit jackets and make
them look as good as anyone else. Through this, I have successfully managed to achieve
that sleek, elegant look with a bit of professionality. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a

be a permanent lineup with Licc? A – LiCC Is partnered with Sri Lanka cricket till 2020 as

coming up twice a year. 3. What would you say is missing in Men’s Fashion in Sri Lanka?
Uniqueness, Colors, Exclusivity 4. As a brand how many pieces do you put out in every
collection? Do you also custom make? A – We only produce 300 pieces per design. This
enables us to give a wider design range to our patrons. 6. Where are you selling these
T-shirts? These Tee’s can be purchased via our Facebook or Instagram Pages or leading Cool
Planet outlets 7. You have priced these T-shirts very affordable, how come? We wanted to

life_fashion90_4_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring_-_Amberry.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - Amberry
Feb 28 2018. This week I feature Amberry to see what is on the market and how they have
been doing in the last one year after their launch. On this episode, I feature their new
product- the wooden tie, which took a long time to master and today you get to buy it in 3
colours and 5 shades. Today I chat with Amry Ahamed and launch the AMBERRY Wood Tie on
Fashionably Danu How has Amberry been performing in the market in the last year? Within
less than a year, we’ve done way better than we expected. The response has been amazing.
We have orders coming in on a daily basis. The brand speaks for itself now and needs
no introduction or promotion. We have an amazing set of fans who we call friends, and they
have been our repeat customers. We have our products available at the leading department
store ODEL and at select vendors such as the design collective, and soon to be in a few
renowned places. What is the process of making one of your original pieces? Sometimes its
just a spark in my head. An idea or a design, and I will burn the midnight lamp until I
find perfection in the product. Having mentioned that, I also strongly consider the use of
bio-degradable materials and off cut wood for our products. Indirectly you may say its an
upcycled product. Tell me the new things you introduced under the Amberry logo after we
last spoke? Our latest addition, the wood tie will be launched on the 7th of March at the
#PressforProgress event by Latika Alok for ladies VIP night. We will take Amberry on the
ramp for the very first time and are excited to bring this to life. Since we last spoke,
we’ve added wooden cufflinks. How is the competition for Wooden Accessories in the market,
and why did you choose wood as your preferred medium? Since we launched, there have been
many players in the market trying to introduce wooden accessories. I am pleased to have
started the trend in the country, and I am happy that more people are paving paths in the
fashion industry for men. The reason for wood as our medium is because ever since I saw
wooden accessories, I’ve always thought it would be an original idea for the Sri Lankan
market. How would you describe your personal style? I draw inspiration from different
sources. I always prefer something Simple, Trendy and Classy. You seem to have been
getting a lot of wedding orders and how has that been, and how do you design for that?
Weddings have taken most of my time within the last year. We tailor make our products to
suit the groom's designs and ideas. This takes a lot of time and patience because I want
to get the product right and add that extra touch of class to one’s wedding. On some
occasions, I have been asked to design and suggest ideas, and this allows me to experiment
my ideas for a wedding collection. Who do you envision wearing your work? Especially the
Ties? You, Danu have done a fair job in wearing and being seen in our wooden bow ties, I
guess now you have the option of choosing between a tie or bow. I’d like to see every
trendsetter out and about in Sri Lanka wearing Amberry bows and ties. You said you have a
lot of things coming up for 2018, what are we looking at? Firstly, the wood tie, which we
are launching in March. We also have tie pins and lapel pins that are in the making.
Something interesting for all our fans would be our Collector’s Edition which we will be
launching on our first year anniversary. What according to you is a favorite part of being
in this trade? Living my dream of being able to produce products that are made with
passion. How long did it take to master the first tie to its perfection, and who do you
get comments from before the final release? Two months. The process isn’t easy, but all
that effort finally pays off with our wood ties having found the right design and cut. I
generally run through product designs and testing with a close-knit circle of family and
friends. I am happy that I have their unconditional support in my journey. Designer – Amry

life_fashion90_4_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring__-_Yoland_Collection.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - Yoland Collection
Aug 15 2017. 1. Tell me about your style of designing? Fashion is something very personal.
I believe that people should wear what looks good on them and which makes them feel
confident. As such I create silhouettes and styles to suit many fashion conscience women
of the world. I am not a slave to fashion trends and branded clothing. 2. What is the
process of making one of your original pieces? The technique of making my creations are
very unique and time consuming as they are all handcrafted with attention to detail. It is
a work of art and they are timeless. I combine many techniques such as batik, tie/dye,
painting, airbrush etc. 3. Tell me about the collection I’m dressed in for this shoot? The
clothes that I have made for you are in keeping with our heritage and culture. They are
inspired by our traditional mask and the paradise bird. I have used silk jute to make your
sarong with jute border insertions. Others have batik and painted combinations. These are
unique pieces of art which require the wearer to have confidence and magnetism. 4. What
are the future plans for the brand Yoland? As I have won many national and international
awards throughout the years, my future plans are to improve the standards of my products
and to climb to the top of the competitive world of fashion which will bring fame to the
Yoland Collection brand and to our country. 5. How would you describe your personal style?
Being a designer I never follow fashion blindly. I do not wear clothing simply because
they are ‘in vogue or are branded.’ I create my own styles in order to enhance my
personality to create an impact. My clothes are feminine, elegant and very comfortable. My
attire is usually minimalistic since most often I prefer to showcase stunning pieces of
jewellery and accessories which I believe is not only classy but also impactful. This
creates a sense of glamour and exclusivity. 6. How do you stay up to date regarding
fashion? As I travel overseas often, I always look for something new and special for
inspiration. Things that are unique and out of the norm capture my attention. The
inspiration can spring not only from clothing but also from the beauty of nature,
architecture, paintings and sometimes from an unusual silhouette worn by a passerby. 7.
Who do you envision wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs?
My designs are worn by many celebrities, Heads of States and the expat community in Sri
Lanka. Internationally, my creations are sold in exclusive boutiques, featured in fashion
catalogues and on international runways. Since my collections are high end creations, the
people who appreciate my work are those who wish to make a statement. 8. What skills
according to you are necessary for a successful fashion designer? In order to be a
successful fashion designer, it is important to stay true to your signature style. Copying
other designers will only bring your product down and will show the lack of confidence in
your abilities as a designer. Start small if you want to make it a business. Treat your
staff and customers well. Attention to quality and detail are of utmost importance. 9.
What, according to you, is you favourite part of being a fashion designer? I enjoy being a
fashion designer since it gives me so much satisfaction to see my creations being worn and
appreciated by my clientele, nationally and internationally. The joy it brings them is so
very rewarding. Moreover the love I have for colour and art are expressed in my designs.
10. How would you describe a Lankan man’s fashion and style? I believe that there are very
few Sri Lankan men who can carry unusual and unique fashions. Most of them prefer to wear
conventional clothing such as western styles. Personally I prefer the sarong and the
national costumes of Sri Lanka and India. Stylized of course! For instance I find Gerald
Solomons’ (of Chagaal), Ajai Vir Singh’s, Danu Innasithamby’s and Prasad Bidapa’s dress
sense truly arresting. The ‘Lovi Sarongs’ bring a unique twist to the conventional sarong
which is interesting and very special as they can be worn, both by men and women. Nuwan

life_fashion90_4_How_Savyscakes_Turned_Cake_Into_Couture.pdf,"How Savyscakes Turned Cake Into Couture
Aug 26 2025. By Rihaab Mowlana The wafer paper was delicate, almost too delicate. One
wrong brushstroke and it would tear, crumple, or worse, disintegrate into sugar dust. But
night after night, surrounded by bowls of cornflour and with edible glue on her fingers,
Chammarie Daniel wasn’t baking. She was designing. A week later, at Noche Latina, her
creations walked the runway. Not stitched. Not sewn. Baked. “They wanted me to do
something with cake, or sugar flowers,” she says. “But I told them I’ll do edible
clothes.” And just like that, Sri Lanka got its first taste of cake couture. When
Colombo’s dance community came together to host Noche Latina, the goal was to celebrate
talent both on and off the stage. Many showcased fashion, jewellery, or styling.
Chammarie, a cake artist with over 13 years of experience running Savyscakes, had other
ideas. “Honestly, it was designs I came up with on the go,” she says. “All I wanted was
for them to look magical.” With no blueprint, no prior experience in edible fashion, and
no real example to follow, she turned to the internet in search of inspiration and found
nothing. “I scoured the internet to see if edible fashion of this kind, using this medium
- outside of cake, of course - had ever been done before,” she says. “I didn’t find
anything. This was the first time I even attempted making edible fabric,” she says. “Even
for a cake.” Her medium of choice was wafer paper, normally used for cake flowers or
edible prints. But Chammarie didn’t want it to look like a gimmick. She wanted texture,
movement, garment. “I made my clothes with something called edible fabric,” she explains.
“It’s wafer paper converted using two simple ingredients that, when brushed over, make it
soft and pliable, with a velvety texture… like fabric.” The pressure was real. “Since this
was the first time I was doing it, I didn’t want to start too early as I wasn’t sure how
long it could be kept for,” she says. “And wafer paper is very expensive, so I didn’t want
to misuse the ones I had already purchased.” Instead, she dove headfirst into a week of
non-stop trial and error. “It took me a little more than a week of long, LONG hours and a
few sleepless nights. I was awed every time I got something right, that I used to stare at
it, mesmerised.” It wasn’t always graceful. “This process requires the use of A LOT of
corn flour,” she adds. “So I was covered from head to toe in corn flour. Every time my mom
saw me, she thought I was losing my mind.” The looks didn’t stop at dresses. Each outfit
came with its own edible handbag, entirely made of cake. “I looooved creating those
handbags,” Chammarie says. “Well, I can’t give out trade secrets, but what I can say is
that for the handbags to hold up like that, the inner structure has to hold strong. Making
standing cakes or gravity-defying cakes, simple physics and mechanics come into play.”
Once again, detail mattered. “Wafer paper is white, so they had to be coloured in with
edible dusts and gel colours to give them those vibrant colours. And I was very specific
about how I wanted them to look, so it took a while to colour them in.” Word spread
quickly backstage. There was edible fashion in the show. But no one really believed it
until they saw it. “The models were thrilled!” she says. “They couldn’t believe the
clothes were actually edible. Even their accessories were edible. Some of the other models
were disappointed that they couldn’t wear edible clothes on the runway.” And the audience?
“I got amazing feedback,” she says. “I was thrilled at their ‘WOW’ expressions. I
distributed the handbag cakes to the audience after the show, so they got a look and taste
of my creativity too.” For Chammarie, this wasn’t a moment of madness. It was the start of
something. “I would LOVE to do it again!” she says. “My mind is blown with the possibility
of things I can do. I’ve already designed new clothes and handbags, and I’m even thinking
about hats and shoes.” If time and budget weren’t an issue? “A wedding dress”. There
wasn’t a grand, stitched-in message behind it all. But maybe that’s the point. “I did want
to showcase my creativity and wanted people near and far to know of it,” she says. “And
also to show that there are limitless possibilities of what you can do with edible mediumif you just put your mind to it. I guess it works for everything else in life, too.” “I
like to create art in every form,” she says. “I’m an out-of-the-box thinker when it comes
to cakes, and I love it when clients give me creative freedom. I don’t like being limited,
and I believe my creativity flows limitlessly. I think my personality resonates with that
too.” Although she comes from a baking background, design and sculpting were entirely
self-taught. “I’ve designed my own outfits at some point in my life - as most women do -
but this kind of designing is definitely new to me,” she says. “I self-taught everything I
know, through watching videos on YouTube.” She sees her work as a blend of structure and
story. “I’m a self-taught sculptor and cake artist, shaped by trial, error,
experimentation, and a whole lot of practice. There’s a philosophy behind what I do:
creativity isn’t just copying; it’s interpreting, personalising, and pushing boundaries.”
“I wish more people understood that edible art is more than just food,” she says. “It’s
craftsmanship, patience, and storytelling. Every figurine, flower, or sculpted detail
takes hours of planning, layering, and fine handwork, just like any other art form.” But
the most powerful part? “It’s temporary; it’s meant to be admired, celebrated, and then
shared as part of a joyful moment. That’s what makes it magical”. She’s been doubted
before. Underestimated by those who couldn’t quite see the scale of her imagination. “Yes,
a few times,” she says. “That happens in my field - or in any field really - when people
can’t wrap their minds around your creative level and your capabilities.” But she doesn’t
mind. “I’ve proved them wrong. Every single time. So I have no qualms”. On that night,
while others worked with tulle, beads, and silk, Chammarie worked with science, sugar, and
sleeplessness. And the runway didn’t just shimmer. It cracked. It crunched. And, if you
were lucky, it melted on your tongue. Rihaab Mowlana is the Deputy Features Editor of Life

life_fashion90_4_Linen_Wear_by_Mosh.pdf,"Linen Wear by Mosh
Feb 11 2019. Mosh Linen wear for men was launched just 5 years ago by budding entrepreneur
Moshin Yaseen, just when linen was making its way in to wardrobes in a big way in Sri
Lanka. The fabric which is supremely suited for hot and humid Sri Lanka, is proving to be
not only practical but also a uber fashionable choice in clothing as well. Moshin explains
more about Mosh and its flourishing mens’ linen wear business. Since launching in 2014,
how have you seen Mosh grow? The response to Mosh has been great and our scale of
production has been growing every year. Linen shirts have become quite a staple in Sri
Lanka, and that is simply fantastic news for Mosh. Could you give us a small inside view
of how Mosh turns out its shirts ? We source our fabrics directly from linen mills from
Korea, India and China and the shirts are manufactured here in Sri Lanka. As for our
designs, we have a team of local designers in charge, because I feel there is nothing like
local talent to create the kind of designs we Sri Lankan’s love to wear. We retail at
quite a few stores including Beverly Street, The Factory Outlet, The Outlet Store and
Uptown Kandy. Linen shirts seem to have been around for a while. Any comments on the
popularity of linen wear and in particular linen wear for men ? Linen shirts have been
commonly preferred in tropical countries in order to survive the heat and ample humidity.
The inclusion of linen by high street brands has heightened the usage of linen as a
material for clothing and this is the trend which eventually cascaded down to Sri Lanka.
However it has managed to stay on as a wardrobe staple for men in Sri Lanka mostly due to
its suitability to the Sri Lankan climate. And why is linen so well suited for the Sri
Lankan climate? It’s lightweight. It absorbs sweat. It not only helps you look relaxed,
but it also makes you feel relaxed. There are a long list of reasons that make linen the
ideal material for the Sri Lankan climate. And what is the latest linen shirt trend to
watch out for? Printed linen party shirts is a trend I am excited about. I must also add
that we now see linen suits and formal pants made with linen being worn widely. So I
believe it is safe to say that it is no longer just a casual-wear material. When styled in
the right way, it proves to be a versatile fabric. What age group of men is Mosh designed
to appeal to ? Our target audience is every Sri Lankan who is seeking to invest in linen
shirts that don’t just look good, but also fits well and makes the wearer feel good. Can
linen wear enthusiasts expect fully-fledged mosh linen wear store in the future? My idea
is to expand a little further before we venture in to a fully-fledged store, but the idea
of it certainly excites me. With quite a few linen wear labels retailing in Sri Lanka ,
why did you choose to launch a linen wear line for men? I chose to launch my own line when
I realized despite the existence of many linen wear labels, I was seeking something more.
The right fit, the right style and most importantly, the right fabric. It is this
combination that has proven to be a winning one for Mosh. Surekha Jayasinghe Your comment

life_fashion90_4_Makeup_Artist_Pallavi_Symons.pdf,"Makeup Artist Pallavi Symons
Mar 17 2017. Collaboration continues: Pond’s BB+ with Pallavi Symons for CFW Neons and
Nudes make a comeback As an independent makeup artist who has experience of over two
decades in the fashion and beauty industry, Pallavi Symons brings much artistic flare and
knowledge to this year’s CFW ramp. Collaborating with Pond’s BB+ for the second
consecutive year, she will share her expertise, showcasing neon and nude palettes. Pallavi
will educate aspiring makeup artists and models alike, on being barefaced beautiful using
Pond’s BB+ and will accentuate facial features with the use of neon makeup. Sharing her
thoughts on the industry and the ever-evolving trends Pallavi joined us for a brief
conversation: Could you explain a bit about your journey as an independent makeup artist?
It has been a long and worthwhile journey for me as an independent makeup artist beginning
in the '90s when I was a commercial model up until date, when the whole business has taken
very new and innovative steps and approaches to beauty as a concept. What started off as a
necessity for a working model back then soon became a career that has now panned just
under 2 decades. I have had the opportunity of working with brands, publications,
designers in India and abroad, models, actors, film festivals, fashion weeks and
currently, and digital platforms, all of great repute. For me, it has just been one long
educational process as I continue to keep abreast of beauty and the business of it and
stay current. What are the new developments in your career? Like I mentioned earlier, it
is important for an artist to stay current and never be left behind with regard to
developments, innovation and trends. The business changes every single day and make up
application in itself is constantly evolving. The thing that I do, given that I work with
actresses a lot is to have to be on trend always. Bollywood pretty much drives the
industry in India and it keeps me on top of things to keep working on the scene. There is
also the digital platform GLAMRS for whom I have to constantly refresh, revise and
reinvent ideas. Between these two platforms, I have my hands full. I look forward to
starting up an entirely online make up course to make available ideas and techniques to my
audience and that is in the pipeline for now. Every day is still a new day at work. What
is your role in this year’s CFW Spring and Summer edition? One of the reasons that I am in
collaboration with Pond’s BB+ cream is due to its brand ethic, its mass reach and appeal
and most importantly its easy availability. I believe that every woman/man has an equal
right to experience modern beauty at its best and Pond’s BB+ makes this possible. My
contribution primarily remains educating our customer by way of simplifying and sharing
the product and its uses/benefits in the best and most effective form. I have worked with
the brand for the last two years and in that time, I have been able to provide a voice and
make up techniques that are easily imitable for those that purchase and use the product.
Last year, I collaborated with the brand to create easy to follow looks using Pond’s BB+
as a base. This year we will be showcasing at CFW 2017, current international trends in
make-up, which will be tailor-fitted to our audiences, be it for daily, night or work use.
Could you talk about the makeup trends that you will be introducing during this season’s
CFW? The mood that Pond’s BB+ is setting for this year reflects international trends that
are currently practiced. The focus will be on nudes and neon! To mention some of the top
trends this year: Nudes (pertaining to skin finishes), neons (to add a very prominent dash
of colour) and iridescence (to add glow/glitter). I will be focusing heavily on using
Pond’s BB+ to create different skin finishes that not only provide coverage but also
create a whole finished look. Of course neons will add the element of fun and play and the
glitters will take it all up a notch further. What are the challenges you see when
adapting the latest make up trends for different skin tones? Well, in countries such as
Sri Lanka, we have mainly medium to deeper skin tones. So the main challenge that presents
itself to me is not the make-up application in itself but the mindset of the users. I findthat most people are unable to get past the ‘Fair Skin’ fixation in-spite of being endowed
with great skin and complexion. It remains my greatest challenge to gently persuade a
client that his/her skin is just as beautiful as anyone else and that there are
innumerable ways of approaching a medium-deep complexion in the most sophisticated manner.
Once that barrier is broken, makeup is a breeze! Makeup is an art that is constantly
evolving: how do you keep with the latest trends? There are two things that this
incredible platform provides to a make-up artist; one, as an artist I am allowed to be
creative and break norms that are set by icons, brands, etc. two, to become the very voice
of those icons and brands to take forward to the regular user, innovations and trends that
appear complicated. So I have a dual job, as an artist and as an educator. So not only do
I need to study the trends but also keep an ear to the ground so these trends are relevant
in our respective markets. While I read up and watch everything related to the business, I
never forget that to progress forward, I need to always be my own person too. My advice to
anyone in the business is to be curious but be unique. Living in tropical weather
conditions with heavy humidity it is difficult to use certain makeup products. What are
the products that you would recommend for Sri Lanka? Yes, it is very understandable that
the weather conditions in a tropical country make product selection a bit intimidating for
a buyer. Here is where Pond’s BB+ steps in, amongst several others. I have personally used
Pond’s BB+ and I can assure you that it is a well thought of product for the country.
While it is a cream (therefore moisturising), it also primes the skin creating a sheer
coat that protects the skin from the damage of the sun and the free radicals that can be
detrimental to the skin. The other products I would recommend are powders (such as
blotting powders that are designed to keep oily zones of the skin, matte), blotting
papers, powder foundations (especially for acne and oily skin), sunscreen, toners (skin
care) and oil free or hydrating (water based) moisturisers. Now there are a host of long
wear concealers/foundations and lipsticks that are available in the markets (and online),
so the world of cosmetics has opened up wide for every kind of user to benefit from their
use. When picking up makeup products, what are the factors we need to consider? Firstly,
and I can never stress on this point enough, every consumer must use moisturiser (unless
otherwise specified by a doctor/dermatologist). It is the foundation for a foundation.
Secondly and as importantly, every skin tone is unique and the sooner one recognises its
uniqueness and beauty, the easier the cosmetic selection process becomes. Trends are cool,
but one must always remember that all trends are guidelines and not a rule of the thumb.
Therefore they should be explored in a manner that is suitable to each individual. One
must never be under pressure by peers or other individuals to buy and use something as
each skin composition is unique and products may or may not work the same way. I would
think that these are key points when one buys make up/skincare. But having said that,
nothing is enjoyable without exploration, so be open to new things and have a load of fun
because the best thing about make up is that IT COMES OFF! What would you advice for
aspiring makeup artists? Well, each aspiring artist is an individual and should be able to
express their individuality. My greatest piece of advice is to have two kits; one
emotional (ability to connect with customers and be smart enough to understand that each
person is different) and one technical (ability to keep progressing with times and use
equipment and product to create the best effects every time on job and also to stay
informed and relevant). Apart from these two key factors which actually define your
career, I also suggest that hygiene of the best possible standards be maintained as it
reflects not just your cleanliness levels but also your mind-set and care for each
customer. Apart from that, artistry is a huge playground, so leave your egos at home,
always and approach this career with a genuine interest and great readiness to create
whether solo or in teams. Your comment (*)",8664
life_fashion90_4_Say_Hello_to_Four_In_Hand_The_New_Mens_Wear_Accessories_in_T.pdf,"Say Hello to Four In Hand: The New Men’s Wear Accessories in Town
Sep 05 2017. Four In Hand is a name to watch. To look smart. To venture bravely. And still
have integrity. These are what they posit whilst adding that extra zest to men’s wear
accessories, fittingly so. Giving weight to this concept is Founder Dulan Perera, who, we
learn is a tie aficionado, often suiting up with precision even, say, for work. In an
email interview, he shares his inspiration behind the brand, also its birth. Excerpts: Can
you guide us through a little bit about what “Four In Hand” is and its graduation from
hobby to a lifestyle concept. As a brand that currently focuses on male suiting
accessories such as ties, bow ties and pocket squares to be exact, the name “Four In Hand”
originated from its accordance to ties. From a plethora of famous tie knots, think
Windsor, Elridge, and the school boy knot is called the “Four In Hand” knot. There from,
to put together the simple concept of picking a tie to complement your shirt; to enjoy the
process of mix and match, are what I have always wanted Four In Hand to represent. Hence,
you could say it was a lifestyle from the start. Four In Hand also evolved for two
reasons. First, it was crucial upon observing a few colleagues’ habit of storing one/ two
ties in their drawers to repeatedly cycle them when needed. For the majority of people
wearing a tie was a novelty. You’d either have to be attending important meetings or a
wedding in order to sport a tie. More so, there was a lack of pattern and colours,
chaotic; as if they chose the ties in their sleep. Secondly, ties aren’t easily
accessible, which is true. Finding a tie here requires mental fortitude. The moment you
wear something flashy or odd, you are noted, worse, called out. So, we at Four in Hand,
run a market to inject some interest among men when it comes to dress sense; while
creating an ecosystem where they bleed a little effort to express through attire. We see a
range of eccentric, bold, full of swish designs in men’s wear accessories such as Four In
Hand. We want to hear your design process and where you get the inspiration from. Initally
it was solely knitted ties, as I wanted to provide customers with what the market had
least of. Later, I understood that it wasn’t just knitted ties that were scarce but also
“good looking” ties. With a log book in my head, I keep buyers up to date whilst serving
those who are evolving with fashion. Next, I look into what Sri Lanka already offers,
because I don’t necessarily want to create an overlap unless I’m able to offer a product
that’s similar but better in quality and value. In terms of colours/patterns, I analyse
what people are most fond of. Like Blue. Sri Lankans love blue. Also the paisley pattern.
Apart from what living in Melbourne while pursuing an Economics degree gave me to take
home, social media is another source of inspiration. Some individuals I closely study
won’t draw any attention locally but I’ll name a few in case you decide to wolf down. Go
give the scrupulous Blake Scott a follow, then search for Grey Fox also, Sergio Ines.
Speaking of those strongly rebelling knitted ties, with the unrelenting sun here it may
challenge some. Isn’t that a fashion risk? Wearing a knitted tie, by no means, makes you
feel warmer. Select precisely and rest assured; a bloke would look hotter in a knitted
tie. Also, never have I felt a dilemma with humidity. I mean it’s a tie, not a cardigan!
In terms of fashion, whether it’s acceptable among local men is another topic in itself.
Somehow though, I received a few snarky remarks when I first wore them here. The usual–
“It looks a bit like a sock.” I would have stopped wearing, had I gave an ear. I think the
resistance to the knitted tie has to do with how many here prefer clichés making it slow
for change. Eventually, like fashion everything evolves. I know this because those who
once called it a ‘sock’ now sport the knitted cropped ties daily. As a bespoke investor,
how do you allow your buyers to choose a model? The business is entirely online. The
investment isn’t as large as I wish it was and we are starting out small. So buyers can
hop onto our Facebook and Instagram pages. All our designs are uploaded. From our pages
they can get in touch via direct messages or a call. Share a few tips on how to tie theright finishing touches to a dapper demeanour. Coupled with a worth of background
influence and experience, I think details demand impact. Picking the right tie or folding
the pocket square acutely will do wonders. My basic rule for the shirt and tie is pattern
and plain. Mix it up! Avoid relying on a strongly patterned tie to complement a plain
shirt. Another rule to gently tuck in is the shoe and belt shade being identical. Brown
belt, brown shoes or back belt, black shoes. Suede and Brogue! Look them up, perhaps
you’re irresolute about making too bold a choice at first, but go on, push the button. No,
really. For suits and pants, arrive at cool patterns. It’s common to invest in dull shades
with most local tailors telling you to. Still, point at that material with the checks and
perhaps frolic with colour. Invade a green or maroon suit. Most important though: get the
fit right! Stay away from shirts on the verge of snapping. Fitted is good, but breathable
is key. Simultaneously, there’s no need for your clothes to make a splash on size. Find
middle ground. As for length, focus more on trouser and blazer sleeve. As far as you can
go, leave both tapered. Flaunt some shirt sleeve and a little sock. Muted shades not
bright whites. 6. The most rewarding part of this business venture for you? This one’s
easy. A satisfied customer gleefully sharing the praises he received on an outfit finished
off with a Four In Hand product . I earnestly wait to hear this right from the moment the
selling is done. It's also a great step towards pushing the Lankan male populace to
sartorial success and outfit experimenting. At the end of the day that’s what we are
trying to do, familiarise having fun with what men wear whilst being measurably self-
conscious. If Four In Hand is the outfit accessory you’re after, reach out to their social

life_fashion90_4_Tahira_Areeb_-_The_simple_yet_luxury_designer_wear.pdf,"Tahira Areeb - The simple yet luxury designer wear
Nov 11 2019. From the young age of five years, Tahira Areeb, owner and founder of the
luxury wear clothing brand Tahira Areeb has always been around stitching and embroidery.
Being a big-kid as a child, finding clothes with a perfect fit was a task, which resulted
in her clothes being stitched from the factory itself. As a reason of being exposed to
dressmaking and tailoring throughout her entire childhood, she was able to absorb the
interest in stitching and always had fond memories of their factory sample room which
became her playground. She started choosing her own colours, her own choice of embroidery
from a very young age. Due to this very reason, stitching has now become her utmost
priority in perfection. Tahira, doesn’t settle for any less in terms of design unless
every particular element is done with complete accuracy. Growing up, Tahira invested
academically towards Business and Accounting, not realising that Fashion Designing is her
ultimate passion. It took her nearly 2 years for her to come to terms that Fashion
Designing is what she has to pursue and changed career paths by enrolling in Academy Of
Design which was her stepping stone to the fashion industry. I wanted to know more about
herself and her brand, so we got talking. How has work been for you after having your own
label? Honestly, it’s been slow but whoever comes and stumbles upon this, they LOVE it!
When they also find out at this is not only ready to wear but we also customise they are
like “WOW we didn’t know that this exists” I’m a big girl myself and I have always
customised by own clothing and I know there are so many out there who want nice exclusive
clothing specially made for them. This is the very reason why I started the design studio
as well. My passion is to cater for women with special tailoring. How do you think your
pieces are appealingly welcomed in the market? The Muslim community really likes it as
it’s more towards catered to them, but this wasn’t the idea for the boutique. The non
Muslim ladies look for revealing and more into dresses and we are looking into that
segment as I understand that there is a market for it. When I started the boutique I
wanted to have a small rail of my clothes and also feature brands bought from the US.
Whatever is found here at the boutique is not found anywhere in the market and that is a
guarantee! Are there any types of clothing that you personally avoid wearing? With age I
have realised the key is to be comfortable! All my life I have been big in size but I have
wanted to dress like the skinny girls but it never looked nice. You have to dress for your
shape, dress for your age and dress for your size. It has to flatter you. I’m personally a
pear shape and I make sure I go for A-line and not for straight cut clothes. Is
international exposure in the making? There is a future plan, where I want to start with
exhibitions in New York and LA because there they have a good number of Indians,
Pakistanis and Asians who also dress similarly with jeans. The whole concept of Tahira
Areeb, is a top that you can dress it up or dress it down, make it casual, change your
bottom, wear flats with it, wear big jewellery, basically go with anything. Prior to that,
I want to first stabilise myself here before international exposure. We have shipped a few
custom made designs to overseas clients residing in Jordan, Dubai and Qatar, but it’s
still not a constant thing, we are working on it. Recently, we were found by a Qatari Arab
lady who wanted us to custom make a dress for herself and her baby for a wedding they had
to attend in Europe and she stumbled upon on us from Google! Who is your fashion icon that
you follow? I really like Anita Dongre, she is a very famous Indian Fashion Designer. I
LOVE her work! What is your current fascination and how do you incorporate it into work? I
travel a lot. Every 3 months or so I travel and each time I do I bring in some inspiration
to my next collection. My current fascination is cherry blossoms during my trip to New
York, where Central Park was filled with Cherry Blossoms, and these particular designs are
currently hand stitched and not machine embroidered to my line of clothes. Recently, I
went to Keukenhof Gardens in Amsterdam and those tulips were like a dream! I brought thatas an inspiration and now the Tulip collection is on the way! What advice do you give for
budding designers? Simply put, if you’re passionate about it, you will somehow find a way
to do it. But then again it also depends on the facilities that people have. I personally
had the chance of working with silhouettes and I also had people who were paid and they
were really good at their job. I’m really grateful to my dad, who has worked so hard so
that today, I can enjoy this because of him. Do you have any rules you live by? I go by my
Dad’s words. He is a very disciplined man. He tells me 3 things are important; 1. Time
discipline, 2. Honesty, 3. Hard work If you can keep these 3 things together you can
succeed in anything you do. Finally tea or coffee person? DOUBLE ESPRESSO ALL THE WAY 3

life_fashion90_4_The_Sari_Aficionado.pdf,"The Sari Aficionado
Mar 02 2021. UK based entrepreneur Shana Mahendra runs a professional photography and
videography company in London. The lissome beauty favours wearing the sari as she feels
confident and comfortable, apart from feeling elegant. While most in the diaspora favour
western attire, there are a few like Shana who don the sari with pride. Shana’s Instafeed
shana_mahendran is full of pictures of her clad in beautiful saris which serve to inspire
her followers on the beauty and elegance of the sari. How old were you when you wore your
first sari? I was 18 and I remember wearing it for one of our school get-togethers.
Although I had an interest in fashion it was when I was about 25 that I realised I loved
wearing saris. Why do you favour sari over western attire? For me, the sari represents
more of myself, and it is more me and who I am. I also believe that the sari is bold, sexy
and comfortable. What sort of saris do you wear? I prefer handloom and cotton saris.
Cotton sarees are so comfortable and you can wear them for any occasion. They can be
dressed up or down to match the function. It is very skin-friendly and breathable too.
When you drape the sari what does it make you feel? I feel that I am draping my culture
and identity around me and that it protects me and it represents me as a person. How do
you think the sari enhances you as a person? It instils a lot of pride and confidence. The
Sari is not just a garment, it is an identity How many saris do you have in your
collection? I haven’t counted them yet but I can safely say possibly more than a wardrobe
full of sarees. When you wear saris for functions what reaction do you get by non- Asians?
I often feel that they see you like a goddess clad in 6 yards of pure elegance. Who is
your muse for sari glam? A South Indian actress called Nayanthara. If you could dress one

life_fashion90_5_A_chat_with_Himaya_Miss_Earth_Australia__Charity.pdf,"A chat with Himaya: Miss Earth Australia – Charity
Mar 27 2023. Sri Lankan born Himaya Wijayaweera recently won one of the 5 national titles
in the Miss Earth Australia National competition - Miss Earth Australia - Charity. Her
love for modelling and pageantry began as a way to express herself and work in
collaboration with other designers and brands. In an interview with the Daily Mirror Life,
Himaya shares her experiences and challenges she faced during her pageantry journey. She
also discusses the controversy surrounding pageants and why she believes they can be a
creative way to advocate for social and environmental concerns. She also shares her advice
to those participating in pageants and talks about her pageantry journey, including
winning Miss Teen Sri Lanka Australia and Miss Earth Australia - Charity. Q As of late,
pageants are mired in controversy and people are questioning why pageants still exist. How
would you respond to this? The pageant I involved myself in focused on a specific goal
about something bigger than ourselves. Miss Earth Australia focused on raising awareness
by advocating for our environmental issues. There is a lot of controversy due to the idea
of judging women through their external features. However, I believe pageants have moved
away from these aspects and focus more on the characteristics of people and their
capabilities. I believe our generation has become more open-minded, creating a change in
the way that pageants can be utilized such as giving a participant a platform to speak
upon. Pageants based on beauty are not necessary, they can be detrimental to people's
mental health. However, for raising advocates to voice our social and environmental
concerns, pageants are a creative way of expression. Q Miss Teen Sri Lanka Australia was
your first-ever pageant and you also won the title? Kicking off my pageant journey back in
2018, I was approached by organizers of the Miss Sri Lanka pageant in Melbourne who
recognised me for my height to apply to compete in the pageant they had coming up. I had
not thought about competing in pageants until my mum told me how she won many titles back
in her day which inspired me to at least have a go. With hard work, I won my first-ever
title after competing for the first time as Miss Teen Sri Lanka Australia at the age of
16. I remember the adrenaline being centre stage, talking about social issues and the
support I received from my family and friends which felt rewarding. Q More recently, you
competed in the Miss Earth Australia National competition and became Miss Earth Australia
- Charity? I took a break after my pageant in 2018 to focus on getting into university and
completing my studies. In July 2022, I was approached by Isha Kulatunge from Isha’s Beauty
Salon Dandenong to try for this year's pageant. Due to the pageant being focused on the
environment, I felt a great passion to compete due to witnessing the neglect by people
towards our environmental emergencies. As a student nurse back in Melbourne, I have been
exposed to the massive amounts of waste produced by our healthcare systems on a daily
basis. Therefore, I embarked on a journey to help find alternatives such as the transition
to electronic documentation and reminders to minimize our wastage. I decided to apply to
compete as I wanted a platform to express my opinions. First, I won the state title as
Miss Earth Victoria. This allowed me to be the Victorian representative in the national
pageant. The national pageant had 23 contestants varying from across all parts of the
nation. It was a six-day pageant boot camp held in New South Wales. We undertook many
activities such as showcasing talent, photoshoots, closed-door interviews and
questionnaires. The six days allowed me to get to know other contestants and build
knowledge on how to be eco-friendly. On the final day, I ended up winning one of the five
national titles and bringing Victoria home a crown. Alongside the national title, I won
the People's Choice award and the Green Achievers award. Q As Miss Earth Australia -
Charity, what are some projects you are embarking on? I want to promote Sri Lanka and
engage an audience to increase our tourism. Due to the state of the nation, I have started
a small goal to convince viewers of my social platform to find a desire to visit SriLanka. Many of Australia’s hospitals have attempted to implement electronic solutions for
documentation. However, firsthand exposure to the build-up of paper wastage in hospitals
that do not have the funding to convert illustrated the urgency of the waste production
emergency. Thus, I am embarking on researching to find an alternative to electronic
documentation, alongside finding a solution to donate funds to hospitals in need. My
project ‘Strive for Sustainability’ started at the beginning of the state pageant. This
project focuses on how we can be sustainable in our daily lives through the simple
activities we do. Expressive and constant messages allow everyone to be targeted to do the
right thing by the environment rather than focusing the responsibility on a small cohort
of people. This project demonstrated how to upcycle clothing for new textiles, partner
with sustainable brands and choose eco-friendly strategies. Finally, I am working
alongside principals in Melbourne to talk to children about the ways they, too, can be
sustainable. This is a valuable project as children are our future generation. Therefore,
starting to send the messages assists to foster and educate children to develop into more
considerate adults in the future. Furthermore, it allows the continuation of messages to
be passed down throughout generations. Q You hosted your own charity event - a high tea
‘Shades of Green,’ to raise funds for charities under the umbrella of Miss Earth. How will
the proceeds from the event be utilised? The entire event was organized from scratch by my
mother Sharline Wijayaweera and my father Jayanath Wijayaweera and I to be hosted as a
‘High Tea’ Charity event. The concept of the event was to illustrate sustainable practices
when hosting events. The location was the Berwick Botanic Garden, hosted on a hill
overlooking the water to allow the attendees to be in awe in and appreciation of the
beauty of our mother earth. We used reusable items and recycled materials for utensils,
minimised wastage by making all our food items in bulk and the menu consisted of no meat
items or processed foods. The donations were collected from the entrance tickets purchased
by attendees. The ‘Shades of Green High Tea’ was a huge success and allowed me a moment to
really appreciate the company of everyone who truly supported me. The proceeds were
donated to the Miss Earth Organisations - Star Production to be put forward to multiple
charities under the umbrella of Miss Earth such as wildlife conservation and tree planting
projects to name a few. Q You are also the ‘People’s Choice Award’ winner? The ‘People’s
Choice Award’ included a voting system allowing the public to be involved. The voting was
opened to people around the world to cast a vote for the person they thought was most
worthy of the crown. Drawing a crowd from Sri Lanka and Australia and other parts of the
world, I won the award with a percentage of 40.6% of votes. In terms of comparison, the
runners-up had 19% of the votes cast. This was a fulfilling moment for me as it
demonstrated how much support I truly had. I would like to thank everyone who voted and
showed support constantly as none of it would have been possible without the collaboration
of everyone. This award and the national title are to be shared with everyone as it is not
a win for only me but every person that showed some love. Q What’s next for you? I had the
opportunity to travel and compete for a title in Egypt, however, I had planned to visit
Sri Lanka in December from the start of 2022. I had been looking forward to seeing my home
country and family, after the inability to visit due to Covid 19 lockdowns but I had to
kindly decline. Therefore, I would love the opportunity to venture into international
pageants and compete in many more. Following the completion of my nursing degree, I would
love to visit Sri Lanka and use my knowledge and resources to set up medical camps to give
back to my homeland. I would visit Sri Lanka’s schools with a small programme to educate
our younger generation about our environmental issues and assist in teaching eco-friendly
practices” Pics Courtesy Himaya Wijayaweera Rihaab Mowlana is the Deputy Features Editor

life_fashion90_5_Beeralu_Braids_catch_Himashi_Wijeweeras_Design_Eye.pdf,"Beeralu Braids catch Himashi Wijeweera’s Design Eye
Sep 17 2018. Himashi Wijeweera will graduate in 2018 October from the Department of
Integrated Design of the University of Moratuwa with a degree in fashion design. Her
graduation collection and research in to the traditional craft of beeralu lace grabbed
attention and earned her a place on several prominent ramps in Sri lanka. Having showcased
her beeralu inspired creations at Colombo Fashion Week 2018 and most recently at the Swim
Week Colombo Luxury Resortwear 2018 as an emerging designer, she is ready to fire up some
interest in a stunning traditional craft which deserves an elevation in to mainstream
fashion. You strongly believe that beeralu deserves a lift in stature and a place in the
world of haute couture. Why so? Beeralu lace is a labour intensive, time consuming, 100%
handmade lace. The level of personal involvement by the craftsmen is very high. During my
research in to this handcrafted technique for my graduation collection, I compared the
technical aspects and processes that are considered in making an haute couture garment
with that of beeralu lacemaking. An haute couture garment is almost completely hand
crafted. It is very labour extensive, time consuming, is custom made, highly embellished
and requires a high personal involvement by the designer in the production process of the
garment. The Sri Lankan traditional beeralu lace trim in its present form carries almost
all the technical and process aspects of an haute couture titled garment apart from being
custom made and embellished. And with some further experimentation done with the braiding
method, it was discovered that this handmade lace can in fact be custom made and developed
into forms with embellishments, thus fulfilling all of the above mentioned criteria.
Therefore, I strongly believe that this craft has the potential to reach the haute couture
level in the world someday. How can the craft be modernized to make it more appealing and
current in terms of fashion? Modernizing this traditional craft requires a twofold
approach. Firstly with regard to the development of the lace itself, I have experimented
with many types if yarn, colours and embellishments using the traditional technique as
well as different braiding surfaces. Secondly the lace needs to be integrated in to
contemporary fashion silhouettes for the lace to be pitched in a different way. Beeralu
lace is traditionally known as a “renda” used as a narrow trim lace to decorate the edges
of a garment. This limits its usage. My vision is to take it from an old lace used for
edging, to a traditional lace with a modern twist. What do you think the average retail
customer needs to know about beeralu lace making? Firstly that it is a struggling and
an endangered craft. The older generations of craftsmen are sometimes reluctant to
innovate and the younger generations of craftsmen are moving away from braiding due to
lack of recognition and various social perceptions around it. There are also fake artisans
selling Chinese machine made lace at the same price of beeralu thus affecting pricing and
demand. The 2004 tsunami also had various long lasting effects on the industry as well.
Beeralu lace braiding process is labour intensive and time consuming. A typical craftsman
can perhaps complete just about one meter of narrow lace in a one day. Therefore, creating
a garment from this lace can be very costly and time consuming. I think consumers do
appreciate the art form and value it. However sometimes there is a doubt if they are
willing to pay the price they would spend on an expensive European lace, for a local
modernized traditional lace which consumes the same amount of time and labour. Another
thing to note is that lace is almost entirely done by women and is geographically
restricted to the Southern Coastal areas of Sri Lanka. In that sense it is a very special
craft. As a young designer, yet to launch a fully fledged label, what are the challenges
you see before you? As a fresher to this industry, I would say one of the main challenges
was to gain recognition as a designer. I was fortunate to be able to showcase my work to
Ajai Vir Singh, the Founder and Creator of Colombo Fashion Week and Design Development
Corporation. But launching a label and retailing can be quite challenging. I need a goodteam and that will take a while to build. I strongly believe that a team should be formed
with people who are passionate about what they do, and not just some people who are
looking for employment. I believe that only when you are passionate about something that
you perform at your best. There is an obvious interest in the beeralu lace tradition among
S ri L ankans . Do you see it sparking an interest within an international audience? After
showing my collection at Colombo Fashion Week to both local and a small international
audience, the comments have been very positive. I feel there are more opportunities in
design aspects for an international audience, than for the local community. What are your
plans for the immediate future? I am working on launching my own label in the near future.
I will be building on the research done for my graduation collection regarding beeralu and
will be using it as the signature element for my label. I hope I will be able to
contribute at least a little towards supporting this dying handicraft. However, I will not
restrict myself to a particular fashion frame as I believe personal satisfaction and
freedom in doing what you want matters a lot for a designer. By: Surekha Jayasinghe Your

life_fashion90_5_Buzz_with_Danu_-_Sabina_T_Yousaf.pdf,"Buzz with Danu - Sabina T. Yousaf
Oct 07 2025. This time it’s extra special, not just because I’m bringing you another
fabulous guest, but because I had the privilege of sitting on the judging panel when she
was crowned. Watching her grace, poise, and composure on that stage was a moment I won’t
forget. She reminded us all that confidence doesn’t have to be loud; it can be graceful,
grounded, and deeply inspiring. From Miss Sri Lanka in the EU to now, wearing the crown of
Mrs Sri Lanka. Today on Buzz with Danu, I’m so proud to welcome the newly crowned Mrs Sri
Lanka - Sabina T. Yousaf! 1. Congratulations on becoming Mrs Sri Lanka! What was going
through your mind when they announced your name? Thank you!!!! My hands were shaking
during the countdown. I believed in myself, but I was standing beside someone very close
to my heart, and that uncertainty was nerve-wracking in a very special way. When my name
was announced, I instantly felt peace wash over me — a sense of belonging. I was
overwhelmed with happiness and deep gratitude toward the judges and the Sri Lankan people
for believing in me. 2. What inspired you to step into this pageant world again, and why
now? So often, after marriage, we women put our personal dreams on hold to fulfil family
responsibilities. What inspired me to return was the desire to show that pageantry isn’t
only for single women — it’s a platform for married women, too. We also have stories to
tell and dreams to chase. I’m deeply grateful to Mr Chandimal Jayasinghe for creating
awareness and opportunities for married women in beauty pageants, and for being so
passionate about empowering us. 3. You were once Miss Sri Lanka in the EU 2016. How
different was that journey compared to winning Mrs Sri Lanka today? I was only 16 when I
competed in Miss Sri Lanka in the EU. I’ve always dreamed of the pageant world because it
celebrates both beauty and purpose — “beauty with brains.” Back then, I was young and less
experienced, but I was mature for my age. Today, I bring more knowledge, depth, and life
experience. Both journeys were unique and meaningful — each shaped me into the woman I am
today. 4. What lessons from your earlier pageant days helped you secure this crown? That
nothing comes easy. In my earlier days, I didn’t fully understand how much work it truly
takes. But I’ve always loved working hard because the satisfaction it brings is priceless.
I learned that giving back and making others proud — especially the people from my small
hometown — is the most rewarding feeling. Sharing my achievements with them is what truly
matters to me. 5. How does it feel to come back into the pageant spotlight at a different
stage of your life? It feels wonderful. I’m more comfortable now because I’ve been through
it before, and I’m also more determined because I know what it takes. I took time to grow
personally, professionally, and academically — so stepping back into the pageant world
with more knowledge and experience makes this chapter even more meaningful. 6. Marriage is
such a beautiful new chapter — how has your husband supported you through this pageant
journey? Gosh, I love my husband — he’s truly the best decision I’ve ever made. He has
been my biggest supporter throughout this journey. My dreams have become his, and his
dreams have become mine. Through communication and understanding, we’ve realised that
together, we can accomplish anything. He’s a proud husband, and that makes me an even
prouder wife. Along with my husband, my mother, father, and entire family have been my
backbone — I couldn’t have done this without them. 7. Winning Mrs Sri Lanka is not just an
individual victory but a family one. How did your family celebrate this milestone with
you? My family has been there for me since day one — especially my mother. From changing
outfits in the car to removing my makeup late at night, she’s been my strength through
every step. I may be strong, but I’m also human, and like everyone else, I need a support
system. My family has shown me that love truly is the foundation of everything. They
celebrated my victory with pure joy and pride — even organising a parade in our hometown
to welcome me back. It was one of the most emotional moments of my life. 8. Do you think
marriage has given you more strength and depth to represent Sri Lankan women on a globalplatform? Absolutely. Marriage has made me stronger and more grounded. I’ve always
believed in myself, but having my husband as my greatest supporter has given me even more
confidence and stability. Representing Sri Lankan women internationally will be one of the
greatest honours of my life. 9. You’ve been both a “Miss” and now a “Mrs.” titleholder —
what’s the biggest difference in those experiences? As a “Mrs.” titleholder, I don’t just
represent myself — I also represent my marriage and my family. That comes with deeper
responsibility and a different kind of pride. It’s not just about individual achievement
anymore, but about embodying partnership, respect, and shared values. 10. Some people say
pageants after marriage are more about personality and balance. Do you agree? Yes, I do —
but I also believe that even before marriage, pageants are about self-growth and personal
development. Whether you’re Miss or Mrs., it’s about finding balance, building confidence,
and learning to represent yourself with grace and authenticity. 11. You carry not just a
crown but a responsibility. What causes or advocacies do you want to champion as Mrs. Sri
Lanka? My biggest goal is to inspire Sri Lankan people — especially women — to follow
their dreams unapologetically. I want to highlight the beauty of our women, our heritage,
and our nation. Most importantly, I want to give back to our communities through social
work and empowerment initiatives. Giving back has always been close to my heart. 12. How
did you prepare mentally and physically for this pageant, and what advice would you give
aspiring contestants? Never give up. The journey can be tough, but mental preparation is
everything. Only one person can win, and that’s okay — what truly matters is growth.
Identify your weaknesses and turn them into strengths while keeping your confidence
balanced. Remember, every step, every setback, every lesson makes you stronger. 13.
Pageants can be high-pressure. What was your strategy to stay calm and confident on stage?
Faith and presence. I always put my trust in God and stay present in the moment.
Meditation helps, but preparation and focus are key. When you find inner peace, it shines
through on stage. My rule is simple — never do too much, never too little. Stay balanced,
be humble, and most importantly, be yourself. Authenticity is your greatest strength. 14.
Who has been your biggest inspiration — in life and in pageantry? My mother, without a
doubt. Her strength, grace, and determination inspire me every single day. She’s the
epitome of elegance and resilience — she never gives up, and that’s the biggest lesson
she’s given me. In pageantry, I deeply admire Rosy Senanayake. The way she has turned her
beauty, intellect, and compassion into a lifetime of service to Sri Lanka is something I
truly look up to. She’s one of the most powerful and accomplished women in our country’s
history. 15. Finally, what’s next for you? Would you be living in Sri Lanka? Yes, my
husband and I are currently looking for our own place in Sri Lanka. However, since we both
have business abroad, we’ll be travelling back and forth for work. We enjoy that lifestyle
— it gives us a mix of cultures and experiences. It takes effort and balance, but we’re
ready for this next chapter together. Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a Marketing qualification

Fernando of Ramani Fernando Salons who has been the official hair and makeup partner for
CFW since it’s inception. Speaking to us about the evolution of runway makeup, Ramani
comments that shift in makeup is that it has changed from more to less becoming more
minimalistic and natural today. “The lip colours are more nude, red and orange and the eye
shadows more natural and smoky.” So what makeup looks would the models be rocking this
season on the runway? Glittery Eyes Exaggerated and bold glitter eyeshadow is trending
widely! Dusted all over lids, cheeks and even the eyebrow, it’s a look that stands out.
“It’s a trend that has come back strongly” says Ramani, “This trend is very significant in
fashion centres of the world and will no doubt be followed in CFW too.” Glittery Lips
Glitter lips have been building up as a major comeback makeup trend and it’s officially
back this season! “Glittery lips would be likely be seen on the models on the ramp this
season” Nude is a look that’s taking over everywhere! From the clothes, the shoes, the
accessories and now the makeup! “Nude is obviously a natural kind of look” shares Ramani,
“if you tend to do smoky eyes which looks very strong, then nude lips are strongly
recommended.” Contrastingly, the neon look is also in trend! This new glow in the dark
look is a massive trend worldwide. “The neon look uses very strong colours like orange,
green and bright pink.” Law Graduate, food and travel enthusiast and full time dog mom..

life_fashion90_5_Designer_1-2-1_Melinza_Fernando.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1 Melinza Fernando
Dec 05 2017. A hobby that morphed into a profession is how one can best describe the
career of jewellery designer Melinza Fernando. Starting out learning the basics, she soon
realised her forte lay in designing and making jewellery using a range of metals and
precious and semi-precious stones. As a jewellery designer, Melinza is very pleased to see
her designs displayed in the Barefoot stores and she is happy that she has reached her
goal of offering simple stylish jewellery at an affordable and fair price. Occupation
before becoming a Jewellery Designer? This is my first professional role and yet I prefer
to approach it as an adoring hobby. I have many interests; food, travel, architecture,
literature and people and enjoy the flavours of all with a sympathetic understanding
towards and feeling for good design. What made you embark on a career in Jewellery Design?
Having a desire to create using ancient tools and techniques with contemporary designs.
Name of label ? Mela.Made.Me What is your latest collection called? The Organic
Collection. Describe this new collection? It is a unique range melding organic metals such
as copper, silver and gold and earthy stones all locally sourced. A collection of
earrings, rings and one inspired copper and silver neckpiece. What metals and stones do
you use? Varying recipes of copper, silver and gold creating distinctive colourings.
Preferred stones are London Blue Topaz, Citrine, Champagne and Olive Quartz, Pearls and
Peach Sapphires. How long have you been a designer for? In 2010, I joined a small class,
which offered a basic introduction to working with metals. As my interest grew, I
volunteered myself at a local Jewellers Workshop where I improved my skills, learning with
rudimentary tools and ancient techniques where everything was entirely handmade and
without machinery. With basic manufacturing skills in place, I wanted to begin creating
the designs I had in mind. I met my current teacher a few years ago and with a passion to
share his knowledge of both design and manufacturing, I have been lucky enough to remain
his pupil improving my skills. I would say I have been designing professionally only since
2016. What inspired this collection? Modern form and translating it into jewellery using
clean lines and textured surfaces with organic metals and natural stones (polished & raw).
What are the challenging aspects of running a jewellery business in Sri Lanka? I feel less
challenged than I do, inspired and free by the opportunity and space I have to design my
original pieces in Sri Lanka. My craft allows me to create at my own pace and with only
handmade pieces, it will always remain a boutique experience showcased at limited outlets
and stimulated further by requests and encouragement from my online followers #melamademe
Where do you retail your stuff? My range is currently showcased in Barefoot Main Store and
Barefoot Dutch Hospital. We hope to launch in their Galle Fort Store soon and may see a
range shipped to the South Pacific later this year. What is your top jewellery tip?
Pendulous Earrings. It's terribly alluring. Jewellery prediction for the next season? I
see Bold Ultra Modern coming. Who would you like seeing dressed in your creations? Frida
Kahlo. How do you balance creativity with commerce? 99% Creativity 1% Commerce. I am very
pleased to see my designs displayed in the lovely Barefoot stores and my goal reached by
offering simple stylish jewellery at an affordable and fair price. Tina Edward

life_fashion90_5_Designer_1-2-1_Thushani_Rodrigo.pdf,"Designer 1-2-1: Thushani Rodrigo
Mar 16 2021. The founder of Todos, Thushani Rodrigo is a shining example of triumph over
adversity. Born with partial hearing, Thushani never let that be a barrier instead with
the guidance and support of her mother and family she followed a sewing diploma at Singer
School of Sewing when she was just 15 years old. She excelled there and passed her Diploma
with flying colours. I first met Thushani when she had her stall at the Good Market. Her
pleasant demeanour, knowledge of patterns and ability to create beautiful garments
attracted many customers. Soon she outgrew her tiny space at the Good Market and then
worked on a larger scale from her home. Her deserved success saw her open her own showroom
and factory at Kalapaluwawa in Rajagiriya. Having launched her brand in 2016 Thushani
continues to develop her products and has positioned herself as a designer and
entrepreneur. Her work ethic makes her a shining example to her peers. What sparked your
interest in fashion design? I was always interested in turning out interesting pieces of
clothing the way I imagined. This imagination made me realize I could do most of the
things I dreamt of doing. That thought was the spark. What made you take fashion more
seriously and make a career out of it? It was a journey that began with my passion for
sewing. As a child, I used to watch my grandmum making clothes and used to help her put
things together. Handling the sewing machine was one of the most exciting things for me.
This childhood passion turned into what it is today. Are you self taught or did you study
fashion design? My early start at needlework led me to learn scientific dressmaking. I
managed to get my Diploma in Dress Making at Singer School at the age of 16 and since then
I have been working on my own. Designing and making customized clothing for friends and
relatives was the beginning of this career. How has your work evolved since you began your
own label? Todos was born in 2016 with 3 staff working along with me. My exposure to the
public was through a stall at the Good Market where we used to sell what we stitched
during the week. That was an interesting time meeting customers and understanding what
they need. In 2018 Todos moved to a new location in Rajagiriya bringing both factory and
the customer frontage together. It was a big step for me and took some time to get the
place settled with machinery and trained staff. Todos brings both bespoke tailoring and
retail clothing under one roof being inclusive with fair practices to everyone. Todos
Bespoke clothing is designed and made to suit customer’s choice ensuring the perfect fit
with a clean finish. I believe in “Your Need, Your Taste, Your Fit” and I will help in
making this come true. Todos makes clothing to suit any occasion in life including casual
to very special bridal outfits. Customers have the choice of bringing their own fabric or
selecting the fabric from our store or leave sourcing with us. Todos ready to wear
clothing is made with durable, breathable and less environmentally harmful fabric at an
affordable price. Any alterations and adjustments of clothing made by Todos clothing are
done free of charge till they last. Describe your latest collection? My collections are
about making people comfortable yet confident and making them feel good in what they wear.
I am introducing more colour variations and fabric coordination to bring vibrancy. Most of
my styles can be worn across a wider age group. There are a few timeless basics that we
keep reproducing in different colour and fabric options as our customers love them. Who is
your muse? I have not pursued the line of a specific muse at this stage. My customers are
very special to me and I take pride in making their lovely dresses which talk on its own
to promote our bespoke mainly by their word of mouth. What are your sustainability
credentials? I believe sustainability is a journey and a way of living and doing things.
At this stage, I would say we are an inclusive brand being conscious of the environment we
live in and practice to be fair by our employees, customers and community we are in touch
with. We work with less impactful fabrics as much as possible, make long-lasting clothes
with good quality for our customers to go through many washes, reduce waste by usingremainders for crafts providing work for needy women, and most importantly supporting our
own workforce with fair wages and work conditions. Further, we are mindful of smaller
things within our control such as minimizing wastage of paper, water etc. We are still a
small team of around 30 people committed to doing little things efficiently, righteously
and consistently. I feel one-day these small things we do will make a positive impact in a
significant way. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your
company? The biggest lesson is confidence in dealing with customers on my own and leading
people very much older and experienced than I to deliver what I want. Being able to
confidently address my entire team of people at meetings is a big achievement for me.
These are the barriers I have overcome. What’s your motto? Keep exploring the best in me
and others and be fair to everyone. What is your favourite part about being a designer?
Being able to see beautiful imagination through people who trust my judgement and has
confidence in my creations. I feel so happy to see my customers wearing what we have done
at Todos. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel, fashion,

life_fashion90_5_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring__-_FMLK.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu: Featuring - FMLK
Apr 09 2019. Today on Fashionably Danu I feature an online store that has been making
waves, keeping it truly local and affordable. Just a few weeks ago, FMLK launched a store
to touch, see, feel and pick up some stunning pieces to dress. http://Fashionmarket.lk
works on looks that are specially curated to define your own style. Keeping it affordable
and Lankan friendly. The pieces I was dressed in were easy on my skin, yet chic, and
worked well with the HOT weather. I love everything there. The ladies have a big
collection with sarees and even the shoes to go with – the designs are original, so worth
a visit – I sat down with the team which has worked on the collection featured today. 1.
How would you describe fashionmarket .lk? FMLK, also known as Fashion Market, is a
phygital (physical and digital hybrid ) emerging designer wear platform, We promote a new
Srilankan style design movement with 3 main targets in our mind named customer,
designer and artisan. 2. What did you want to bring new to fashion, and what would you say
is missing in Men’s fashion today? We saw a gap for a new modern Sri Lankan style and our
effort is to fill that gap. For example, we looked at ways to modernize the Srilankan
National tunic so that every guy would love to try it on. 3. How does the team work on the
designs - what’s the design process? We have a team of designers working towards one
creative direction while adding value through their unique individual handwriting. 4.
Fashion inspirations, how often do you have new collections coming in? This is our very
first men's collection. We will be launching new collections more often in future with the
learning and feedback from our new collection. 5. How has the feedback been and what would
be the next step? We launched the collection on Tuesday, 9th April but the collection has
been at our newly opened store at Greenpath and the feedback we have got, so far, has been
great and we continue to get positive feedback. Lots to learn! 6. Tell me about the
designers who are working on the collections we see? Annmarie worked on this first
collection as she was passionate about menswear and was wanting to take a challenge. Going
forward, we will be working with designers like Anne Mendis who will add a different style
also to the current range. 7. With the arrival of all these new designer stores, what sets
FMLK apart which will give you longevity in the market? We have been in the business for
almost 4 years now. We have been selling to Sri Lanka, India and a few other countries. We
learnt a lot within the last 4 years and fine-tuned our platform keeping the 3 pillars as
our core; which is customer, artisan and designer. Whatever we do is all about creating an
impact to these 3 pillars of our brand taking them to the next level. We also drive a new
Sri Lankan style movement combining low tech &and high tech industries. 8. You guys are
specific about the fabrics for your garments, tell me about the process, and how long did
it take to master this? We mainly use handcrafted handlooms and batiks as well as
carefully selected upcycled fabric from industry surplus. This is not an easy task as lead
times can be really long sometimes but we have managed to come up with re-engineering
processes to reduce the lead time as much as we can. 9. Who do you envision wearing FMLK
designs? FMLK –MAN first collection is all about relaxed urban dressing, heralding a
modern new Sri Lankan style. So FMLK - MAN will be someone who mirrors this personality.
10. What have you featured on this collection? In terms of silhouettes - We have added
tunics, sarongs and Tshirts with modern lengths, detail and prints. Photographer – you're
my favorite Danu is a Jaffna Boy with a Marketing qualification (only because he needed to
study, and not because he wanted it). He has been a part of the team for seven years and
is the face behind Buzz with Danu, and WTF. Your comment (*)",3975
life_fashion90_5_HSBC_Colombo_Fashion_Week_Day_2.pdf,"HSBC Colombo Fashion Week Day 2
Aug 15 2020. Day 2 of Colombo Fashion Week held at the Shangri-la saw a clutch of
established designers present their collections. Central to their collection was the ""RE""
theme set by Colombo Fashion Week which focused on creating clothes without harming the
environment. Colombo's well-heeled were out in force to support the island's main fashion
event of the year. Aslam Hussain Aslam’s signature style is creating high fashion looks
which add visual drama through his unique ability to turn simple fabric into stunning
couture creations. His craftsmanship as a designer lies in skillfully engineering fabrics
to create visually dramatic clothing, bringing an air of sophistication and finesse to the
wearer. Inspired by the festival of Holi his colour palette included bright hues
interspersed with pastel shades. His collection was a departure from his usual high
fashion couture look and instead, he presented down slightly pared-down versions of his
usual uber-glam creations. Engaged in a mission, Lovi aims to bring the thrill of sarongs
to the world by introducing the first patent-pending designs with built-in pockets, belts,
and lining to suit modern lifestyles. LOVI aims to spark excitement about Sri Lankan roots
as well as foster confidence about our island home, and help define a new Sri Lankan
clothing identity. Using the finest silks the collection which was in jewel box colours of
red emerald and blue also had a sprinkling of silver and gold threadwork. Asanka’s the
founder of the brand had used the Salmala as his leitmotif for this collection. Dinesh
Chandrasena presented a monochrome collection with asymmetrical hemlines on a range of
silhouettes. The summer 2020 collection from WRAITH draws from the Japanese concept of
“kintsukuroi” where broken porcelain is REpaired with lacquer work, underlining that
something REworked has more intrinsic beauty and value. The fabrication of Bamboo in
colours of Onyx and Alabaster have jute artisanal embroidery by Panchali Liyanawaduge
using thread from discarded jute sacks. This is highlighted with broken porcelain pieces
REworked by the creative team with discards from Dankotuwa porcelain. Maintaining his
inimitable style, FH presented a collection of snazzy suits with floral jackets. The
collection also featured smart suits with single and double-breasted jackets creating
dapper looks for the style-conscious men of Colombo. For FH this season, the collection is
all about happiness and the power of colours while focusing on sustainable fashion. The
collection created to depict the positivity through colours also had as its goal to
educate men on how to choose the colours that fit your tone. It was a collection of
masculine tailoring with an extra serving of happiness for those that dare to be dapper.
Award-winning jeweller Vogue Jewellers made its debut at Colombo Fashion Week. Necklaces
earrings pendants and bracelets bore testimony to the exquisite craftsmanship that Vogue
is renowned for. The show stopper was a pair of drop earrings which could be illuminated a
first of it's kind in Sri Lanka and even the world Inspired by the gorgeous aspects of
mother nature and it’s amazing creatures, KOCA by RN presented a combination of summery
floral day wear recreating the concept of office into evening wear with a luxurious twist.
A quirky eclectic collection of separates which can be mixed and matched with ease.
Retaining spot as Sri Lanka’s premier couturier Dimuthu Sahabandu revealed a promising
collection. Beautiful red-carpet-worthy evening dresses in black, gold and biscuit with
embellishments made their way down the runway. Dimuthu is blessed with an ability to
tease, cajole and manipulate fabric into place so that it creates the most beautiful
drapes. The collection derives its inspiration from Kuveni and the aboriginal inhabitants
of ancient Sri Lanka, ‘Yaksha’ and ‘Naaga’ tribes. The collection consists of a range of
hand-embellished evening wear and includes a few one-piece silhouettes designed to be
deconstructed and worn as separates after the first couple of wears as a one-piece
garment. Upgrading and prolonging the lifespan of these hand made garments. Pics by

life_fashion90_5_LOLO__LALA.pdf,"LOLO & LALA
May 10 2022. Fashion designer Senuki Wijesundera launched her label ‘LOLO & LALA’ over the
weekend at The Design Collective Store. A fashion student of the Academy of Design, Senuki
has completed 2 years of her BA in Fashion and Marketing. LOLO & LALA’s debut collection,
the Exclusive Wear Edit, uses the luxurious Armani pure silk as the mainstay fabric of
choice in a range of free-flowing silhouettes and styles. We catch up with Senuki to talk
about fashion, design, and launching LOLO & LALA. Q What got you into fashion and design?
I’ve been into fashion since I was a kid. I was raised among women and my mum was really
fashionable when I was young so being around her, her sense of style played a big
influence on why I love fashion. Travelling also got me into fashion and design.
Especially going to India, walking on the streets from shop to shop and being around
clothes was actually a reason that made me so into this. Q What’s the label ‘LOLO&LALA?
Lolo and Lala is a Fashion, Beauty, and Lifestyle brand. We strive to allow you to explore
your style in a manner that is reasonable and inclusive. We are hoping to achieve this via
our digitised platform that not only consists of LOLO & LALA merchandise but also products
from established and start-up brands. Q What’s LOLO&LALA’s debut collection? The debut
collection that we just launched is called the ‘Exclusive Wear Edit’. The collection
consists of luxurious, sophisticated designs and these are all made out of Armani pure
Silk. We have signed up with The Design Collective store for this collection so these
styles will be exclusively sold at The Design Collective store. Q How would you describe
your signature style as a designer? My fashion style is almost a direct derivative of my
mood, personality, emotions. It changes from time to time so I’d say it’s a very adaptable
style because the world is changing every second and fashion needs to adapt to that! Q
What inspires your work as a designer? Being a fashion designer is a lot of hard work and
one of the hardest aspects of it is actually finding inspiration for your work. But
envisioning something, finding the right inspiration and vision, and bringing it to
reality is what makes me strive to be a designer every second. Q How was the launch of
LOLO & LALA? Honestly, it was a long process with a lot of hard work. The last few days
leading up to the launch went by in such a rush. I had many, many sleepless nights and I
was extremely nervous at times in anticipation of it. But the launch was so successful and
looking back at it, I am super proud of everything and how it happened. I couldn’t be
happier. Launching LOLO & LALA was a team effort and I wouldn’t have been able to do it if
not for the LOLO & LALA team, The Design Collective team, and my partner! Q What’s been
challenging about launching LOLO & LALA? With the current economic crisis, fabric prices
are increasing every day. And with the energy crisis and all the power cuts, it’s so tough
to get things in order and on time because the entire production comes to a halt. The
staff is finding it hard to even make it to work with all the expenses they have to commit
to and everyone is struggling so much to make ends meet. Seeing them the struggle is truly
heartbreaking. Launching a brand always has challenges but it has been especially
challenging in these times. Q What’s next for the label and yourself as a designer? We are
actually coming up with our e-commerce multi-vendor platform and I’m very excited about
that! Our vision and mission are to allow our customers to explore their style in a manner
that is reasonable and inclusive. To ultimately provide purpose and existence to our
customer's desired lifestyle products whilst ensuring that we cater to a wide range of
tastes and styles by allowing the collaboration of other brands onto our e-commerce
platform. Instagram: @loloandlalaofficial Website: www.loloandlala.com Law Graduate, food

life_fashion90_5_LOréal_Paris_3_Pure_Clay_and_Yuzu_Lemon_Bright_Mask_Review.pdf,"L’Oréal Paris 3 Pure Clay and Yuzu Lemon Bright Mask: Review
Mar 07 2018. The L'Oréal Paris Bright Mask is one of the Exfoliating and Cleansing Masks
that is infused with a strong Yuzu Lemon extract using other three pure clays particularly
to exfoliate and brighten skin. A blending of Kaolin ( to absorb impurities and excess
sebum), Montmorillonite ( rich in minerals) and Ghassoul ( to help clarify complexion)
make up the pure clays. According to the description, it is active with exfoliating
particles that cleanses deeply into the pores to absorb oil and eliminate dead skin cells
leaving an even radiance keeping the skin moisture intact. So, does it do what it claims?
The pot comes in a green package with a weight of 50 ml of yellow clay. It’s been three
weeks since my purchase and having a constellation of old acne scars, uneven skin tone
plus blackheads on my nose, I had a feeling this would do me some good with exfoliation.
The texture of the cream is a lot thinner than I thought it would be and comes with
exfoliating particles that was not too abrasive on the skin when I applied. (Make sure the
face is not in contact with water, but dry before application because the texture becomes
runny real soon). While applying, I’d also suggest a light finger massage in circular
motions wherever desired. Once the mask is prolonged to stay on the skin even after 10
minutes, it doesn’t become a problem. As a result, a smooth luminance is evident with the
clay pulling out the unnecessary dead cells stuck on skin. Above all, no traces of
irritation. I’d advise to use the product once a week for those with sensitive skin. Other

Aug 10 2017. Love it or hate it, you will have to drag yourself out of your home every

Shopping is their adrenaline and they engage in the activity with revered fervor. They

life_fashion90_6_Balmains_Bold_Bags_Designed_by_Sajith_Amaratunga.pdf,"Balmain’s Bold Bags, Designed by Sajith Amaratunga
May 12 2025. By Tina Edward Gunawardhana When I first saw images of Olivier Rousteing, the
creative director of Balmain, carrying a sewing machine bag at the coveted Met Gala, I was
blown away by the subliminal statement of the bag. When I realised it was created by
Sajith Amaratunga, who had graced the Hi!! Magazine cover, I was awestruck and reached out
to the Paris-based star leather goods designer to find out more. At this year’s Met Gala,
some of the most talked-about accessories came from the hands of Sajith Amaratunga, the
rising leather goods designer at Balmain. From Rosalia’s satin Anthem pouch to Jenna
Ortega’s navy fur version carried at the after-party, Sajith’s creations stole the
spotlight. But it was Balmain’s Creative Director, Olivier Rousteing, who made headlines
with the showstopping Sewing Machine Bag—a sculptural, fully functional piece inspired by
the tools of the tailor’s trade. Sajith, who has grown steadily within the Balmain atelier
over the past five years, brings both technical prowess and a flair for storytelling to
his designs. The process behind the Sewing Machine Bag involved deep historical research,
intricate craftsmanship, and a race against time, resulting in a piece that was both
wearable and symbolic. For Sajith, the moment Olivier carried it up the Met steps was more
than a career milestone—it was the realisation of a long-held dream. 1-At the recently
held Met Gala, many celebrities were carrying bags you had created for Balmain—can you
tell us which celebrities carried your handbags on the red carpet this year, and how those
collaborations came about? The one that is on everyone lips is of course Olivier
Rousteing, our creative director of Balmain,. this year he carried the Balmain Sewing
Maching bag. The other celebrities that attended the Met Gala wore variations of the
Anthem pouch; Rosalia wore a white satin version while Patrick Scharzenneger from White
Lotus 3 opted for a burgundy leather. Jenna Ortega who wore the iconic rulers metallic
dress for the Gala chose a navy blue fur Anthem pouch for the Met after party. These
collaborations are arranged between Olivier, the VIPs coordinator and the celebrity
stylists, together they decide which are the best options to present at the event.
Sometimes for really iconic pieces like the Sewing machine I have a direct meeting with
Oliver to see which direction he wants to take and giving him options to choose from.
2-The sewing machine handbag made quite a statement. What was the inspiration behind that
striking design, and how did it align with the Met Gala’s theme of dandyism? Yes we are so
happy that is has been so well received and that the public has appreciated it. Our main
inspiration was effectively the tools of a tailor so as per Jenna Ortega’s dress was made
by rulers, Rosalia represented the mannequin that we have in our studios and the Sewing
machine is the main tool we use to make garments. 3-Can you walk us through the process of
creating the sewing machine bag—from sketch to red carpet—especially the technical
challenges involved in making such a sculptural piece wearable? After Olivier asked me to
make this piece for this important event my first approach was research. I started
browsing from the first machines ever created to the latest ones of these days in order to
create something never seen and mixing different parts of history together. We had limited
amount of time so it was rush against time. I presented the first sketches to Olivier and
after his approval i made the technical sheets studying in detail every single part of
this bag. I included symbolic details hidden in some parts such as our carry over diamond
grid engrave on the left side, the number 44 on the big wheel that rapprenset the number
of the first HQ, etc. 4-How do you balance pushing the boundaries of concept design—like
with the sewing machine bag—with maintaining functionality or wearability? Many have asked
if it was just a sculpture, but I have to say, to your surprise, not at all. It would have
been too easy to have a bag-looking object. The challenge that I had and that excited me
the most was to transform a sewing machine into a functional bag. On top, you can clearly
see there is a closure, and when opened, you can clearly fit items inside. It is quitespacious and you can fit different items easily in it. The handle was made of leather, and
I took inspiration from our carry-over luggage. 5-What kind of craftsmanship and
techniques were involved in producing the Met Gala handbags, and did you collaborate with
any specific artisans or workshops? Yes, we worked with this well-known supplier with whom
I’ve already collaborated and that creates wonders also for brands like Valentino, Gucci
and Dolce & Gabbana. Obviously, for privacy reasons, I cannot share the name. 6-As a young
designer, what was it like seeing your work carried by global celebrities on one of
fashion’s biggest stages? I have to say that i feel really grateful for having had this
opportunity and i have to thank Olivier for trusting me with this project. It has been
always my dream to have one of my creations on the Met Gala stairs and the reason that
made it even better was having Olivier himself carrying it, who has been my inspiration
since day one. 7-You’ve been with Balmain for several years, growing from an assistant to
junior designer to a designer. How has your creative voice evolved during that time? In
september i will celebrate 5 yrs in this incredible maison. I feel Balmain is an amazing
school where since the beginning i learned so many things. I grew as a person and as a
designer. The beauty of our job is that we keep evolving and we never stop learning. Every
day there is a challenge to face. I feel at the beginning I was more shy but with the
gaining of experience i felt more confident to share my thoughts and visions. 8- Looking
ahead, how do you envision your role in shaping the future of leather goods—are there any
dream projects or themes you’d love to explore next? That is an interesting question, but
I think I’ll keep the secret. As you know, I’m quite superstitious and I believe that
something has to be kept in order to become true. So stay tuned for the next steps haha

Mar 09 2021. When did you launch your brand? I launched the brand in 2017 but I launched
my first ready-to-wear collection with The Design Collective in February 2020. What
sparked your interest in fashion design? Having been the not so stereotypical boy, I
always loved creating something out of nothing and it definitely sparked my interest in
designing. I always loved playing with colours and different materials when it comes to
creating art and a few of my teachers encouraged me to take the route of designing instead
of following the same paths that most of my friends wanted to follow. What made you take
fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Being the youngest child of my family
I was raised in an overprotective way. So my family wanted me to follow the footsteps of
my sister and be a lawyer which made me follow a degree in law right after finishing my
Advanced Level studies. But soon after completing the first year of the degree, I realized
that Law is not something I enjoy or was destined to follow. I still remember the days I
used to sketch during the lectures instead of paying attention to the lessons. So I
decided to take a risk and give up my Law degree for fashion (which a lot of people
thought to be a stupid decision) and create a career out of it. Of course, it did not go
well with my family which ended up with me having to be independent instead of being the
momma’s boy that I always used to be. But at the same time having to create my own path in
designing made me learn so many lessons. Are you self taught or did you study fashion
design? I consider myself a self-taught designer. Of course, I followed a course in
pattern making because I highly believe that a designer has to learn the basic
fundamentals when it comes to constructing a garment. But apart from that, I have spent
all these years learning so many things by myself. Sometimes being a self-taught designer
helps simply because you are not taught by the rules of fashion as what is right or wrong,
which eventually makes you want to take risks and try new things without hesitating. How
has your work evolved since you began your label? I take every day and every experience as
a learning process. So looking back to where I started as a designer, over the years I
have definitely found who I am as a designer and what my signature is. I feel like I have
become confident with my aesthetic with every passing year and ambitious to take up
challenges when it comes to trying new things. Are there any types of clothing that you
avoid designing? I’m definitely open to trying new things when it comes to designing but I
always want the women who wear GAI to feel comfortable in what I create. For me, designing
is also respecting and appreciating the beauty of the human form. So it’s all about making
my client stand out for all the right reasons with class and sophistication. So I wouldn’t
design anything opposite of the above-mentioned keywords. Where do you look for creative
inspiration? I think a part of being a designer is having the ability to see the unseen
and appreciate the beauty and the worth that is being overlooked or overshadowed as much
as appreciating what’s considered as typically beautiful. I draw inspirations from all
sorts of things, but something that would always be dear to my heart is mother nature and
the beauty of women of different ethnicities. Describe your latest collection? I just
launched my latest collection called “The Invitation” which is a collaboration with the
talented artist The Mood Stock. We used three masterpieces from her art collection as our
inspiration to come up with four different prints that evoked the emotions and expressions
of the human face. It is about inviting everyone to embrace and accept yourself as who you
are. Thameesha Eliyapura, the artist behind the brand The Mood Stock is amazingly talented
and has a great eye for colours and I love incorporating bold hues to my designs. So the
results turned out to be amazing. The collection is now available at The Design
Collective. Who is your muse? I consider independent, confident everyday women as my muse.
I find it’s absolutely admirable when a woman is comfortable in her own self especially at
a time where society is after the concept of perfection. But for the last collection,Thameesha and I both wanted to take individuals who take pride in themselves by being who
they genuinely are as our muses. What are your sustainability credentials? Personally, as
a brand, I believe that any move towards sustainability is a positive one regardless of
how big or small the efforts are. As a team, we are doing our best to reduce waste while
improving productivity. Also upcycling is something we often try to incorporate as much as
we can when it comes to creating new collections and I always try to use techniques that
are more eco-friendly while creating an income for those who are in need with fair wages.
What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your work? Abstract
Art, My current collection already features Line art which is a form of abstract art. It’s
bold and quite out there and very visual which complements my design aesthetic. What is
the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your company? The biggest
lesson I have learnt is to take risks and to follow my heart. Giving up a Law degree and
going against my family’s will could definitely have ended up as a disaster as I was told
by so many people what I did was not so wise when it comes to my future. But looking back
now taking a major risk has definitely paid off. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

life_fashion90_6_Fashionably_Danu_-_DXL.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu - DXL
Nov 13 2018. Today I speak to Adhissha the lady who founded the brand DXL. The place and
the fashion line is getting a new sexy look, and just because you are curvy it doesn’t
mean you can't be fashionable or trendy and that’s what this band is helping us do Today

and longs, some of which can be your everyday casual fix while some others, your premium
formal fix! Take a look at what’s in store here! 1. What is the new collection all about?
The new collection is all about formal and casual wear for men. 2. Why the name change to
DXL , what's new about this? DXL is the premium brand for plus size that we are newly
introducing to the market. 3. What made you start this collection? Our flagship store
Double XL has throughout the years paid attention to detail and comfort in our
collections. This time we are taking it up a notch in an effort to bring you premium
products for your everyday formal and casual wear wardrobe. The attention to detail is far
more meticulous than we have ever been before. 4. You have changed the cut and fit for
this collection, why and how did you work on this designs? Yes, there are a few changes
that we’ve made in keeping with making this collection a premium one. We worked on these
from scratch keeping in mind that we really don’t have a premium plus size formal wear or
casual wear brand providing great product choices to our plus size family elsewhere in Sri
Lanka. Naturally, we took it upon ourselves to do it! 5. Would you be getting into online
marketing? Yes, very soon! However, we are proud to say that we have a great loyalty base
that keeps coming back to our store and really enjoy the shopping experience there. 6.
Where and when can we see the new collection on shelves? The collection will be up for all
your seasonal purchases from the 24th of November onwards at our flagship store located at
#31, Lauries Ln, Colombo 04. 7. With the arrival of all these new designers, especially in
fashion, what sets you apart which will give you longevity in the market? The fact that no
one else does what we do sets us apart from the rest. We’ve been around for a long while
now and the ‘plus size family’ as we call it considers us to be their go-to-store. Brand
loyalty will always keep us going! 8. You guys are specific about the fabrics for your
garments, tell me about the quality, and how long did it take to master this? The plus
size consumers will never compromise comfort for anything else. Our fabrics need to have
‘comfort’ written all over it. The level of comfort we seek is the level of premium
quality we hope to deliver. This has taken us 9 years of experience to learn. We don’t
think we have mastered anything yet. Everyday is part and parcel of the learning curve
that we treasure. We are really excited for what we are bound to learn and the exciting
things we are to do for our customers in the near future! 9. What's next for the brand?
Something ‘big’ is coming soon. That is all we can say for now. 10. What have you featured
on this collection? We have featured our new range of premium mens wear. It comprises

life_fashion90_6_Fashionanbly_Danu_Tharshana.pdf,"Fashionanbly Danu: Tharshana
Sep 16 2020. Today I feature an amazingly talented man who has really created a brand
that’s absolutely beautiful and timeless, Tharshana is known for making his designs from
the stretch, every single element of his design is made by him which makes it more special
and valuable today. This artist speaks about his ever-growing brand and what makes him the
designer he is today! Q What sparked your interest in fashion? Art! As a kid, I wanted to
find a way to connect Art with people. I wanted to see people wearing my artwork. I didn’t
want my paintings being limited to papers and canvases. I wanted to give them motion and
bring them to life and fashion provided me with a way to do that. Q Tell me about your
collection which you have featured in this shoot? This particular shoot actually has a
few shirts from the last few collections, which have really been extensions of my Mythical
and Whimsical themes. Each shirt incorporates a different Sri Lankan grown
flower, illustrated with a mythical animal appearance. Q Tell me about your brand name and
what you want to leave as a tradeMark for your brand? My brand name is my own name. I
started as an artist and had already built some recognition through my art. By building my
brand around my name in the fashion industry, I wanted to make sure I kept it true
to who I am. This also helped me to relate to my clients on a personal level. I like to
believe my trademark is tied to my art and my desire to bring my art to life through
fashion. In that sense, the illustrations that go on each and every one of our products is
a unique piece of art, with each one being born out of my own mythical world (at least as
far as this collection is concerned). Q As a designer how many pieces do you put out in
every collection? Do you also custom make? We keep our collections as exclusive as
possible. I believe in quality over quantity. The materials that our shirts are made of
are very delicate and it takes a great deal of time and attention to manufacturing. While
at the same time, I like to give our customers the opportunity to own a product that you
know only a handful of other people own as well, to build that unique experience of owning
a designer wear product. Q What are the retail outlets which carry your brand? At the
moment we are retailing at Urban Island - 181 Srimath Anagarika Dharmapala Mawatha,
Colombo 7. The Pelican store at ShiroHana Petal Guru - 61 Dudley Senanayake Mawatha,
Colombo 8. Q What is the process of creating and marketing your design? Your design
inspiration? Everything starts with the artwork itself. This is the part of the process
that takes the longest as I hand draw each of the prints with the utmost attention to
detail. My current collection I have created a mythical and a whimsical world with flora
and fauna, my inspiration being Sri Lankan grown flowers incorporated with my own
imagination of “Mythical” animals. Then the sampling starts from printed swatches,
matching the colours and choosing the right scale for the print. Then I create a sample
for each design and try it out myself before going into production. This is very important
for me to check the quality of the product and to see how it makes me feel and I try
getting my friends to wear samples and get some feedback too. And I keep a close track of
the manufacturing process. Attention to detail is very important. Q Who do you envision
wearing your work? Do you think about this when you work on designs? Everyone. Always try
to picture my designs on people during the design process which really helps me to choose
colours and decide which print will work. And try my best to match the print colour to
compliment every skin colour as well. Q Are you self-taught or did you study fashion
design? I studied my BA in Fashion and Textile design at the Academy of Design. While I
learnt a lot at AOD, I have been doing volunteer work ever since I left school. From body
art, to make up, to live fashion illustrations to backstage support, to working as a
fashion designer for a leading garment manufacturer all of these have contributed to my
intimate knowledge of not only the design and manufacture process but also presentation. Q
What would you say are 5 important items which need to be in any man’s wardrobe? Whitet-shirt, Blue Raw Jeans, Custom-tailored suit, Printed Bold shirt and Chinos. Q When you
decide you will create your own fabric? And did you ever think it Will pickup so well? Not
at all. I was actually very nervous with the first collection and wasn’t sure people would
see things the way I did. As for when I wanted to start my own thing, I guess that was
something I always wanted to do. I knew I didn’t want to be designing for someone else, as
for one, it really restricts you and forces you to design inside their “box”. I
wanted to create my own whimsical world through my fabric. Also, I noticed a lack of
fabrics that had Sri Lankan grown flowers incorporated. There is a lot of fabric out there
with western flowers incorporated but I couldn’t find any that incorporated flowers
that are grown in Sri Lanka. As more and more people started to purchase and wear our
products, they started to recognize the flowers on the garments and message me saying that
the same flower on their product is also in their garden. This felt really rewarding for
me as I wanted to give my clients that experience and it really felt like I had succeeded.

Mar 27 2018. Colombo Fashion Week reached the end this weekend, after days of jam-packed
runway style and endless front and back row style stalking, I've rounded out my favourite
looks from the last few days. My best-dressed list from Colombo Fashion Week is a shout
out to those who impressed with stellar looks! Thursday - 22nd Adrian - This is a great
example of tailored fusion fashion that Adrian does so well. It's the perfect look for
fashion week. Nitesh - This is an incredibly dapper look which Nitesh has perfected. The
watch fob, two-tone brogues, and monochrome palette are a master class in mixing vintage
tailoring with modern collections. Chathuri- The blending of three distinct designer
pieces, the Gucci cardigan, Valentino rock stud clutch and YSL tribute sandals are the
perfect way to stand out at fashion week. Friday - 23rd Heidi Delicate draping, fluidity
and a monochrome navy palette make for an extremely stylish and fashion-forward look.
Rishini This studio 54, Halston- esque style looks fabulous with its asymmetrical hemline,
leg-lengthening nude sandals, and disco diva gold YSL clutch. Shalin The thing about
Shalin's style is that it really is extremely cool. He has his own vibe that is charming
and rakish with solid style game. Impressive! Suzy This black dress is classically
beautiful and elegant with its lace detailing. Black pumps ,a pop or red lipstick and a
red YSL clutch are the perfect pairings. A classic little black dress with a twist! The
cape sleeve, a hugely successful silhouette from Valentino is such an interesting look and
I like that Noah has paired her dress with simple straps sandals and added visual interest
with her Louboutin studded Paloma clutch. Saturday 24th Darshi - The perfect brand
ambassador for Buddhi Batiks, I love the insouciance of this look, the statement T paired
with a glamourous sweeping skirt is a fabulous look! Tymeron - The while laid-back cool
vibe that he has going on here is so fashion week and bang on trend paired with his white
trainers. Effortlessly cool! Karina - The whole pyjama party look, championed by Dolce and
Gabanna, Gucci and a number of other big houses and beloved by Naomi Campbell is still
hugely on trend and I love Karinas pairing with her Gucci horsebit loafers. Sunday - 25th
Jaishree - This fun and fabulous look stand out for all the right reasons, the colours ,
silhouette, and accessories all work well. Your comment (*)",2490

life_fashion90_6_Meet_The_Designers_of_CFW_2017_LOVI_Ceylon.pdf,"Meet The Designers of CFW 2017: LOVI Ceylon
Mar 09 2017. Founded by Asanka de Mel back in 2015, LOVI Ceylon crafts luxury activewear
sarongs. Designed in San Francisco and made in Sri Lanka, LOVI is an upcoming brand
redefining an age old item of clothing loved and worn by many Sri Lankans. LOVI Ceylon
will be debuting at the Colombo Fashion Week this March so we catch up with CEO, Asanka to
hear his thoughts; Tell us a little bit about the brand LOVI Ceylon and how it came about?
LOVI is a modern, contemporary take on sarongs. Functionally our sarongs have pockets,
belts, and lining to make it easier to wear and move around, hands free. Aesthetically,
it's contemporary and dressed up. We’re innovating a garment that belongs to our heritage.
It’s a lot of fun, but we also take this seriously. LOVI has a U.S. Patent on the design
of pockets in sarongs. What’s the story behind the name ‘LOVI’? My fiancée was studying
fruit vocabulary in Sinhala. I was thinking of names for the business, and it clicked.
Plus LOVI sounds like ‘love.’ What’s better than that? Why sarongs? Everyone looks amazing
in sarongs. No matter your body size, whether you’re a guy or girl, we all love sarongs
and feel good wearing them. But over time, they stopped innovating on sarongs. How are you
going to wear a sarong outside without a place to put your phone? So we put in a pocket,
and a few other practicalities. Because our modern life is one in motion, isn’t it? You’ve
taken a Sri Lankan household clothing item and made it into a fashion statement of your
own. What makes LOVI sarongs so different? It’s a giant canvas! I am overflowing with
ideas. Sometimes I have to pace myself to avoid trying everything new at once. We’re
always thinking about the trends. Yesterday’s sarong wasn’t meant to be worn fashionably.
LOVI is. It’s your debut at the Colombo Fashion Week! How does it feel to be showcasing
LOVI? I’m very excited about this debut, and honored to show LOVI among Sri Lanka’s top
designers. We’ve been working hard, so it’s a thrill to finally have a chance to show it
on stage. It’s been a challenge to think about the difference between a runway show and
making clothes people want to wear. You can’t see how good these sarongs feel unless you
try them on. The feel is probably the most important thing about a garment to me. But I’ve
added a little pizazz to my pieces to jazz up the show! What’s the LOVI Ceylon collection
for Summer 2018 all about? LOVI's theme ‘Modern Ceylon’ is inspired by our ideas to renew
and reclaim the sarong. It’s the push and pull of identity in a globalized world. How can
we be simultaneously uniquely Sri Lankan, or Ceylonese and a global citizen? Within Modern
Ceylon, the collection has a nautical theme. We explore the land as an island, surrounded
by a vast ocean; the seafaring, explorers of Sri Lanka. What’s the one stereotype about
sarongs or wearing sarongs that you’d like to prove wrong? I want to remind people that
the sarong is an inclusive garment. Whether you are Tamil, Sinhalese, Muslim or Burgher,
no matter your age, gender, or body size, you look good in a sarong. When you wear a
sarong, you show you are proud to be Sri Lankan. We did a survey to find that almost 75%
of Sri Lankans wear sarongs—but mostly at home. With modern, on trend designs, LOVI is
giving men and women permission to wear the sarong they love outdoors, fashionably. How do
you see LOVI Ceylon expanding in the future? Today, when people think of Sri Lanka they
think of the sun, beaches, spices, and Ceylon tea. I want to add LOVI to that list. I want
LOVI Ceylon to have an identity that’s instantly recognizable around the world - as
authentically Sri Lankan, world-class fashion. I want to see the sarong and our
traditional clothing renewed as designer wear. I want kids to want to wear LOVI. Law

life_fashion90_6_Transeasonal.pdf,"Transeasonal
Oct 26 2017. Forget traditional and soon-to-be irrelevant spring/summer/autumn/winter
fashion; Make way for the new future in fashion Not too long ago, Spring/Summer meant
colour, overstated prints and fun fashion statements that instantly spoke of sun, beaches
and beautiful summers. Meanwhile, Autumn/Winter meant muted shades, dense outerwear and
multiple layers that put you in sobre, cool moods; those were the rules. But lately, it
seems that seasons are, in fact, so last season. In a world where downloading a new movie
or just-released song is at the click of a button, audience’s patience for waiting for
season-led content is wearing thin. Down at the other end of the conversation where
climate change and pollution is getting too real for everyone’s liking, wearing clothes
for just one season is starting to seem simply, plain selfish and uneducated in terms of
the global catastrophe that the Earth is facing. This is where the new term
‘transseasonal’ fashion becomes the new hero of the fashion elite across the globe. It
presents an effortless style where eternally relevant basics get paired with more
personality-pieces that hint subtleties of where and when, to lock down appropriateness of
the ensemble. With major fashion labels like Stella McCartney and Burberry tapping into
this transitionary mood and ready-to-wear labels like TopShop catching on to the trend
early, ‘Transseasonal’ has become the look that everybody in the fashion world seems to
want to channel. Introducing this new aesthetic and fashion frame of mind to Sri Lanka,
Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week launches the concept through the country’s inaugural fashion
week scheduled to take place next week. Seasons are no longer an important part of the
design process – or, depending on the view you take, all the more important – the global-
rather-than-local customer base. Fashion consumers today are increasingly transient global
citizens whose lifestyles, work and travel patterns have taken on an unprecedentedly fast
pace of change. Therefore it is only natural that people no longer think in terms of a
small town where they were born in- the fashion buyer today will purchase considering what
he or she will wear when they travel to the tropics in a few months’ time— during which
they will also go for that one work meeting to meet a potential client abroad—, and
meanwhile it should also work at home where it is a less than comfortable temperature.
Transseasonal makes much more fashion sense to this consumer. It is also a philosophy
propagated by the see-now-buy-now e-commerce culture and open retail system, as well as
capsule collections, trunk shows and special collaborations that are mushrooming
throughout the year, reshaping the fashion landscape today. Responding to this change,
where wearables are no longer defined by a strict fall/winter and spring/summer annual
calendar, designers today also have started thinking in terms of timeless pieces that work
as basics, statement pieces or layering. Transseasonal also resonates well with today’s
contemporary approach to fashion which takes sustainability very seriously. With the
environmental crisis being the super-crisis of our age, it is no surprise that the modern
generation is not taking shortcuts when it comes to the longevity of the planet- this
includes their fashion choices and making more permanent choices that resonate with their
lifelong personal style, rather than a short-term trend, stopping mindless tonnes of
clothing waste going into landfills and waterways, polluting Earth. Zooming in on Sri
Lanka, ‘transseasonal’ is also a fashion philosophy that works better for a place where
there are no visible seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter; where the weather
changes, though erratic, are more long term and steady going from rainy to sunny with
little or no change in temperature. Mercedes-Benz Fashion Runways will present this so-now
fashion frame of mind to Sri Lanka, pushing the local consumer mindset and fashion labels
to embrace the international fashion business’ latest move. MBFW 2017 will take place on
the 27th, 28th and 29th of October at the Mercedes- Benz Centre of Excellence DIMO 800.

Feb 28 2019. HSBC Colombo Fashion Week in its 16th year expands the retail program to
include interesting commercial opportunities for the participating fashion designers. This
format is created to connect the designers with the relevant consumers. One of the key
focus of CFW has been to open up interesting commercial opportunities for Sri Lankan
Fashion Designers, in keeping with that objective, this season of CFW will see two key
initiatives - Look & Book App , which is an interesting new format of fashion retail and
concierge and a curated one-day store retail Edit . ""Not only is retail growing, it's also
taking interesting shapes and forms to reach and engage fashion consumers, the format of
retail is changing with the introduction of newer technology on your palm, and for our
designers in Sri Lanka we are attempting to make use of these interesting formats. There
will be more on this space."" Says Ajai V Singh, Founder & Managing Director of CFW The
first program involves a platform to purchase online. The Look & Book application created
by Smoking Dots Pvt Ltd, creates a special shopping experience by making the outfits on-
ramp available to be booked during the fashion shows at real-time, and lock in the
purchase on the same day. On the days of the fashion shows, the guests get a chance to
book a design related to the designers showcased on that particular day just by accessing
a link on their smartphones. The Second program is the offline format of a One Day curated
retail, it is a version of a temporary retail store or a pop-up. This has been a good
success in the past too, but it is being reformatted to make it even more effective for
this season. There will be a special for the HSBC Premier Customers and the guests of CFW
shop the latest collection and interact with the designers. ""Retail has always been an
integral part of CFW, and over the years we have tried new formats to support the fashion
designers commercially, there is also an ongoing program to mentor and guide the younger
designers so they can be retail ready and to that we are now adding a platform so
designers can also engage with fashion consumers commercially."" Says Fazeena Rajabdeen,

life_fashion90_7_Day_1_Mercedes_Benz_Fashion_Week_Sri_Lanka.pdf,"Day 1 Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka
Oct 23 2018. We are just days away from one of the most high profile events in Sri Lanka’s
fashion calendar, the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka. Held in collaboration with the
AOD and DIMO, this year’s event will see 65 designers showcase a variety of collections
ranging from athleisure and knitwear to childrenswear and casualwear . MBFL Sri Lanka is
also considered a springboard for many young designers to launch their new collection and
this year we are especially keen to identify Sri Lanka’s new design talent. Spread over
three days, here’s an exclusive preview of some of the designers from Day 1 of Mercedes
Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka. Anuththara Rajapakse: 1.What does it mean to take part in
Mercedes Benz Fashion Week Sri Lanka? Showcasing on an international platform such as this
is a great opportunity to show the capabilities and design talent within our fashion
industry. The experience and exposure for designers and industry alike is amazing. 2.Can
you describe the collection you will be showcasing? This collection is inspired by the
80’s sportswear, comics and Harajuku fashion. It embodies a spirit of whimsical childish
playfulness. The silhouettes are feminine yet fun, accentuated through the mix of bright &
quirky embellishment. 3 .What is the inspiration behind this collection? As much the
collection is mainly inspired by the Harajuku fashion and 80’s sportswear, it is also
inspired by what I am working on at the moment which is kids wear and ladieswear. 4 .What
do you hope to get out of this experience? As a fresh graduate from AOD and a designer for
Hirdaramani Knit Cluster, this experience has helped me grow and learn as an individual
designer. 5 .What is the unique selling point of your collection? As a women’s and kids
wear designer I wanted to experiment with the theory that kids wear can influence trends
in women’s wear as well, where it can be tweaked into wearable designs for those above the
age of 15 years. This collection is loud, playful & bright aimed at bringing the inner
child in you. Thushie Jayasekera What does it mean to take part in Mercedes Benz Fashion
Week Sri Lanka? Mercedes Benz is a global brand, a brand that everybody aspires to be
associated with. I am grateful for Mercedes Bens Fashion Week Sri Lanka for creating a
platform for local designers to voice their opinion, to create, connect and collaborate
with international thought leaders and partners. Can you describe the collection you will
be showcasing? Inspired by the iridescent shades of the sea and the tropical colors of
coral reefs and fish, Sub-aquatic Glitch by TINK is a collection of ready to wear
garments, consisting of Fringed Mini dresses, embellished pieces and cover-ups capturing
the movement and texture of the magical world down under. What is the inspiration behind
this collection? It was a snorkeling trip to Trincomalee, that ignited my interest in the
deep sea and the magic it contains. The colors were surreal and defined what paradise
would look like! Swimming amongst the black tip reef sharks and a countless variety of
vividly colored tropical fish emerging from the extensive range of textured corals, still
remains my most distinct and precious memory. 1 .What do you hope to get out of this
experience? Exposure to the industry and a network of peers and like-minded people who
believe in fashion for a cause and an opportunity to get people on to conscious fashion. 2
.What is the unique selling point of your collection? The unique selling point of this
collection would be the vibrant colors, the fringing and embellishment techniques that
have been used Leshani Peiris 1 .What does it mean to take part in Mercedes Benz Fashion
Week Sri Lanka? It’s a great honor and a privilege to be showcasing my first collection at
MBFWSL since it’s a great exposure and is a great way to put your own brand out there to a
local and international viewing audience. 2 .Can you describe the collection you will be
showcasing? My collection is a menswear collection which is heavily based on form and fit
since its inspiration stems from tailoring techniques as did I want to challenge the
traditional men’s sartorial figure. I tried to stress on the gender ambiguity, that I
personally think should be present in all clothing. 3 .What is the inspiration behind thiscollection? For the silhouette inspiration I looked into suits of armour of the medieval
era, I mixed this with Men’s tailoring techniques from the late 40s to the 50s, which is
considered the golden age of menswear. This inspired me to use a bold colour palate, and
use pattern mixing techniques in my fabrics for which I used pinstripes and hound’s-tooth
checks. 4 .What do you hope to get out of this experience? I hope to prove to myself as
well as others of my creative capabilities, and learn from my mistakes and grow as a
designer as well as be inspired for the future by all the talent and great personalities
that I would hopefully encounter at this event. 5 .What is the unique selling point of
your collection? Usually men’s garments are centered on functionality with bulky surface
details, whereas women’s garments are not. As I mentioned before I see no need for this
disparity and I think we can borrow techniques and silhouettes from both genders so long
as they fit the cut and form of a male/female body. My unique selling point would be that
even though its menswear, if it fits you right, it can be worn by anyone irrelevant of
their gender. Imasha De Silva 1 .What does it mean to take part in Mercedes Benz Fashion
Week Sri Lanka? It's definitely exciting to be a part of the MBFWSL and it is a great
honour that provides us and the Academy of Design with brilliant exposure. MBFW improves
our standards and the local fashion industry alongside one another and I am definitely
excited and nervous to be a part of it! 2 .Can you describe the collection you will be
showcasing? For my final year collection I wanted to showcase designs that were feminine,
fun and wearable. Chloe is and remains one of my biggest inspirations so I wanted to
channel their aesthetic. I used bright prints taken from my hand drawings inspired by
.....and used details like ruffles, snakeskin and embroidery for an extra dimension.
Overall I wanted my collection to be really pretty, romantic and wearable and for women to
enjoy wearing my clothes. 3 .What is the inspiration behind this collection? This
Spring/Summer 2019 collection was inspired by the silhouettes of cowgirls and Prairie
girls. Prairie girls influenced the feminine feel to the collection, while insect prints
were inspired by vintage insect botanical drawings and antique Valentine’s Day cards
inspired the print of the roses. The colours of the silhouettes were inspired by vintage
posters with ruffles and snake-skin used as a nod to the cowgirl. 4 .What do you hope to
get out of this experience? The MBFWSL is an International fashion show, and being a part
of it for a young fashion designer is good exposure for an early start in our career,
whilst getting the chance to showcase our first collection. I hope it improves our skills
and presentation whilst associating with internationally accredited fashion designers. I
hope to keep expanding my career in fashion and see MBFW as the first step. 5 .What is the
unique selling point of your collection? The unique selling point of this collection is
that it is one-of-a-kind yet wearable. My prints came from all hand drawn elements that I
manipulated in Photoshop which gives it a truly personal and unique feel. With my
collection, I really see the 'girl' who wears this and I think that is every girl, it is
feminine but has cool detailing like snakeskin, it is an edgy romantic collection. Tina

Dec 15 2020. Based in Japan, Sathomi is heavily influenced by Japanese culture and
customs. A graduate of the AOD, Sathomi creates looks that fall into the genre of street
style. What inspired the pieces? The collection is my personification of Japonism. They
are a few of my favourite forms of Japanese art and culture put together. This collection
was a blend of Japanese silhouettes and prints, incorporating Sri Lankan heritage crafts.
I wanted to design and create pieces incorporating these two different cultures I adore.
Who is your muse? “Ami and Aya” A popular fashion duo. They incorporate modern and
traditional Japanese fashion pieces to create street-style looks. What is your design
ethos? My design ethos is a mixture of contemporary street-style with traditional
aesthetics. I love to create handcrafted textiles and put them together with prints. What
are your sustainable credentials? I worked on some pieces in the collection using leftover
textiles which I used to mix and match with different prints and textures from the
collection. Also, my woven textiles and batiks are artisanal textiles, which I worked
together with the artisans themselves. How would you describe your creations? My pieces
are bold, fun yet sophisticated. A few pieces of my collection are androgynous. Tina

life_fashion90_7_Fast_Fashion_Friend_or_Foe.pdf,"Fast Fashion: Friend or Foe?
Sep 02 2024. Ever wondered why that button from your new shirt is already popping off? Or
why your jeans are all faded out despite it being only your second wear? Knock, knock!
Fast fashion has reached you. Fast fashion is considered to be cheap, trendy clothing that
is mass-produced to follow the current styles in the industry at prices that are
attractive to the public. At first, it sounds like a neat deal - stylish clothing that is
incredibly convenient and affordable. However, a closer look into it exposes a business
concept that has been criticised for poor quality products, a staggering amount of waste
and unethical company malpractices. This industry aims to encourage people to spend more
and purchase clothing that can be discarded quickly so that the cycle can be repeated yet
again for the benefit of the companies. In a nutshell, fast fashion comprises the
following: Fast trends: Producing new styles with an attractive price tag has always been
a defining trait of the fashion industry. However, looking back, designers and brands
would organise new clothing ranges many months or even years ahead of release. Today, the
focus has pivoted to responding to consumer tastes that constantly change according to
what is popular with social media influencers or celebrities. With the power to reach
millions across the world via the internet, a simple photo of them in a new outfit is all
it takes to go viral. Followers and fans would discuss the look and share it with each
other creating a buzz, and thus, a new trend would be born. Fast fashion companies would
then take notice of it and respond promptly to the increasing demand and rush to mass
produce these trendy outfits, often targeting young people who engage in this culture.
Fast production: With trends gaining popularity at lightning speed, producers are
compelled to manufacture clothes and accessories accordingly to keep up. Factories are
expected to produce new lines on short notice meaning that their employees usually have to
work unreasonable hours for a measly pay. Fast sales and delivery: Global clothing sales
have doubled from 100 to 200 billion units while clothing usage has decreased by 36% since
the year 2000. A drastic increase in sales during the COVID-19 lockdown was a large
contributor as consumers were inevitably pushed towards online shopping. With appealing
holiday sales, discounts, cheap deals for quick delivery and easy payment options, there
is little self-control when it comes to such a marketplace. Fast use: A rough estimate has
shown that an average item of clothing is only worn 14 times before its wear and tear
catches up to it. Fast production entails using cheap and easily accessible raw materials
such as synthetic fabrics to cut down on manufacturing costs. Most items are also not
thoroughly inspected before sale and customers are bound to purchase a faulty and less
durable item more often than not. Akin to anything too good to be true, digging deeper
into this quick and easy cash model reveals two highly critical entities that pay a heavy
price. Environmental impact In a recent interview, Lonali Rodrigo, founder and designer of
a local sustainable and conscious lifestyle brand - House of Lonali, exposed the harm
caused by the fast fashion industry on the environment. She revealed about 2,700 litres of
water is required to make just one kilogram of cotton. Additionally, sources show that
cotton production uses 6% of the world’s pesticides and 16% of insecticides which
eventually reach water bodies and oceans resulting in water pollution. The industry also
leaves a hefty carbon footprint, responsible for up to 10% of total global carbon
emissions and is estimated to increase by 50% by 2030. It doesn’t just rely on the energy
from fossil fuels to run garment factories and distribute items around the world but also
to develop textile fibres from these very fuels. For example, polyester is a synthetic
man-made fibre derived from crude oil and natural gas and is commonly found in at least
half of all the textiles produced in the modern day. Textile waste from these fabrics ends
up being burnt or dumped in landfills after being used only a handful of times and it
takes about 300 years to fully decompose, causing natural ecosystems to suffer greatly.Some of this waste consists of new items from clothing lines that have become outdated too
quickly, failing to reach a consumer. Rodrigo stated that shops have to clear out racks
constantly to keep up with the often unnecessary trends that spruce up fashion, regardless
of whether the outfits are climate-appropriate for a country like Sri Lanka that doesn’t
experience all 4 seasons, and the result is accumulated waste that has to be destroyed
instead of sold. The trapped women workforce The fast fashion industry thrives on employee
exploitation as cheap items usually require cheap labour. Research from The Ethical
Fashion Report in 2023, has shown that although there has been some progress, it would
take at least 75 years before all companies paid a living wage at a minimum of one factory
per company. Between the unsatisfactory pay and working long hours in cramped facilities,
workers are also harassed during business hours and in some cases, outside of it too. As
the majority of these factory workers comprise women from struggling families who have
moved from their hometowns to the city, sexual and verbal assault seems to be the
unfortunate norm that most are extremely uncomfortable with. Various global accounts of
women including from India, Pakistan and Cambodia show that their male supervisors stalk,
ridicule and pass inappropriate comments to them on the regular expecting these workers to
either oblige or accept termination from the company. Human Rights Watch interviews with
these workers show that many workers are unaware of their rights as employers under legal
terms and even if they are, they cannot seek strict protection. Despite the growing
numbers in fast fashion, it is still possible to wield this phenomenon in the right
direction. Go thrifting By opting to shop for secondhand clothing and accessories in
garage sales or thrift stores, you can extend the lifecycle of an item even just for a few
extra months, thereby reducing the relative carbon, water and waste impacts of it. A
surefire sign of a durable item is that it can be owned for a second time, given its
condition. With some luck, you could come across a limited item from your favourite punk
band from 20 years ago! Get creative Hone a few basic sewing skills and you’re on track to
creating a unique fit with the old clothes lying lazily in your wardrobe. This method of
‘upcycling’ reduces the demand for raw materials and adds value and charm to original
pieces. Consider mending an item before chucking it in the dump - an old skirt does not
necessarily need to end up in a landfill. Support local and sustainable brands Aspects
ranging from a company’s use of clean and green raw materials, ethical employee practice
and adherence to animal rights by not producing items that use animal fur or leather are
vital to consider when deciding on a purchase. Choosing to support local brands will
ultimately reduce carbon footprint levels and aid economic growth, which is crucial to our
country in the big picture. Your comment (*)",7366

life_fashion90_7_Making_Your_Suit_Look_Bespoke_A_Guide.pdf,"Making Your Suit Look Bespoke: A Guide
May 14 2024. Hot and sweaty summer weddings are days away, and as much as you can
celebrate not being the groom (this time!) It’s time to dust out your old suit and dry
clean it for a fresh new feel or give it a makeover and make it look premium and bespoke.
If you are one of the lucky ones able to purchase a new suit or get one custom-made from a
bespoke tailor in town, Have at it! I had the great pleasure of discovering that even a
suburban tailor offered vicuna wool (made famous by TikTok-savvy Loro Piana) to discerning
customers willing to spend LKR 2.2 Million on the upgrade. A well-fitted suit can make a
powerful statement. However, not everyone can afford the bespoke option, or even the
custom-made one. The good news is, with a few tips and tricks, you can make an existing
suit or a store-bought look like it was tailor-made for you. Here are some strategies to
help you achieve that bespoke look without breaking the bank. Shop the look, but not the
Fit From personal experience you can easily find great blazers on discounted racks or even
full suits for bargain prices; Priced even below what you would pay to rent it. Make sure
you finalize on one that’s got a looser fit, even longer arms because you could definitely
take it to a tailor and have it adjusted. Always double-check for rips and construction
errors. They are discounted for a reason. Conservative Styling is King Right now,
oversized suits are all the rage. Even the 80s-style padded shoulder. Suiting trends like
that will come and go, but having a suit that’s got standard details (conservative lapel
style, neutral solid colour, durable fabric, two buttons etc.) will be worth its weight in
gold. Conservative styling for suiting never goes out of fashion. Except for three-button
suits. Burn one on sight. Change the Hardware Some suits get handed down from one
generation to another. But suits, much like all things age and need to be updated from
time to time. The updates definitely can make a huge difference. Consider updating the
inner lining, the buttons as well as the lapels or the pocket flaps. Sometimes, it could
simply be adding a fake prick stitch to the end of the lapel to give it that hand-stitched
illusion. This works even on store-bought suits with plastic buttons; consider switching
the buttons to metal caps for a regal finish. Killing Me Softly, with the Accessories As
an elder millennial who watched the rise of pocket squares in Colombo, I am happy to see
it become a suiting staple. I myself have used fancy printed pocket squares at one point
or another to hide a well-worn suit, paired with a complimentary tie that is. My general
rule of pairing is; if the suit is striped or printed, opt for a plain tie and pocket
square or vice versa. I do realize most stores now sell sets of matching ties and pocket
squares, but that doesn’t mean you need to use them at the same time. Mix and match
colours and prints where possible. And don’t wear a loud tie if you don’t have the
personality to carry it. Divorce the Pants, Darling We are all guilty of it. We wear the
pants more often than the blazer. It’s no secret when you pair it back only to find a two-
tone feel to your look. But why not lean in and experiment? I tend to pair my blue blazer
with a host of other pants (black/grey/denim/khaki/white) when the occasion calls for it.
It’s possible for all kinds of blazers and trousers. Even prints. Aftercare is Self-care
As the mid-year wedding season draws to a close, let’s not lose sight of the impending new
year period that is looming too. Avoid spraying perfume on your blazer, buttons or
accessories directly (that’s what your shirt is for bro!!). If you also didn’t sweat like
a pig dancing with a whiskey glass over your head, you are free to brush your suit and
slip a cover over it before it goes back into your cupboard on a hanger. A dry clean once
or twice a year is also highly recommended to extend your suit’s life span. We’ve all seen
that video of Steve Harvey extolling the virtues of a wardrobe with several suits. It’s a
great notion that I wholeheartedly agree with considering my line of work as well as the
lifestyle I keep. It’s not for every man, and I hope you do not feel compelled to match my
wardrobe requirements. Having said that, I must also mention, that no man will ever failhimself in having more than one suit that fits him well. Everything else, I consider a
bonus in the life and stature of the modern man. A fashion stylist with a decade of
experience as an image expert and consultant to local retail brands, Gayantha offers

life_fashion90_7_The_Best_Dressed_List_from_Colombo_Fashion_Week.pdf,"The Best Dressed List from Colombo Fashion Week
Mar 22 2017. Boasting an exceptional lineup of Sri Lankan and international designers,
Colombo Fashion Week is one of the much loved, most awaited events and a great way to
showcase fashion and style both on and off the catwalk. From emerging and established
designers, ethical fashion, fashion and film, art exhibitions, after parties and specially
curated menus, Colombo Fashion Week was a celebration of all things design. There were
memorable highlights on the ramp like La Sari’s unflinching commitment to denim which was
served up beautifully with batiked designs, modern clever and visually stunning. Emerging
designer Savindri Kuruppu's bold punk spirit with exquisite grafitti-esque embroidery on
everything from prom dresses to t-shirts, her collection is one that wouldn’t look out of
place in wild underground clubs, an emerging star and one to watch! Darshi Keerthisena of
Buddhi Batiks, who really can be credited with reviving the art of batik and bringing it
to the forefront of fashion's consciousness, didn’t disappoint with a collection that
travelled from ethereally beautiful to exquisitely crafted and reminded us once again why
she’s the star that she is. Dimuthu Sahabandu showed a rarefied and elegant collection
that can work on the myriad silhouettes of the women who order from him. The thought
process behind the importance of sleeves fully integrated into the total design of any
given look. The artfully and strategically placed beading designed to emphasize and de-
emphasize different areas of the body. And the preponderance of the art of fluidity and
draping and how it can be deployed to flatter the wearer. A designer in the truest sense
of the word. Charini Suriyage and Ramona Oshini both showed collections that were
stunning, femme fatale yet wearable and creatively exquisite. There were many more
memorable collections and the fashion off ramp was equally memorable. Here are my picks
for the Best Dressed from Colombo Fashion Week. Your comment (*)",2040

Mar 20 2018. The founder of ‘nnnn’ | ' itr ' pronounced as it- ra (which means essence)
Khyati Pande is fastidious about the work she creates with each design carefully crafted
by curating and juxtaposing textiles of different varieties. She uses an eclectic mix of
fabrics and textures which blend perfectly together to create her unique looks. She is
inspired by her passion for travelling and love for Indian textiles. Khyati is a graduate
from the National Institute of Fashion Technology, Mumbai and has done a Post Graduate
qualification in Textiles from the National Institute of Design Ahmedabad. Her collection
is being retailed at The Design Collective in Sri Lanka. What’s your fashion ethos? Design
for me is pure, unbiased and uncomplicated, Where clothes are not defined by time, trend
or space, rather they are adaptive to its wearer and is multidirectional. What made you
embark on a career in fashion? The creative seed was genetic. Everything from home linen
to my clothes was hand embroidered and sewn by my mother and grand mother . Old sarees
were recycled into quilts, worn out sheets were converted into hand embroidered
pillowcases . This not only was my point of inclination towards design but also sensitised
me towards a sustainable material practice. After pursuing my undergrad from NIFT, ‘nnnn’
started without any blueprint as a homegrown design laboratory with a small budget and one
tailor in a room on the roof of my home. Name of label ? ‘nnnn’ | ' itr ' pronounced as
it- ra (which means essence What is your latest collection called? The latest collection
is called 'where the wild things are' Describe this new collection? My inspiration came
from the color burst of the speckled wildflowers, which is depicted in the form of scanty
hand-embroidered florals in the garments fused with handwoven silk bhandej ( Hand-tied &
hand dyed) freckled dots, handcrafted in Gujarat. To highlight the bold color, the
silhouettes were kept minimal, boxy and playing with the fabric volume. The textile
textures used are cotton-silk blends, silk muslins, and silk satins, which adds on to the
daintiness. How long have you been a designer for? Professionally Ihave been practicing
design for the past 4-5years What are the challenging aspects of running a fashion
business? Starting a business meant, getting ready for stinging rejection, constant
criticism, extreme financial pressure and never ending hard work . I believe that the core
of every good brand is the product, which is not just compassionate towards its end user
but also towards its craftsmen as well. There is always a stigma attached to every
designer wear in the form of an intimidating price tag. Especially when you are working in
the craft sector where each step made by hand has its own variable pace of time, costs
incurred tend to be on the higher side, but keeping them balanced without compromising on
the brand value and finesse of the product, at the same time to cultivate a taste and
understanding for the same in the market is the real challenge. Where do you retail your
stuff? The brand started with an ecom -store and we are currently retailing in Sri Lanka
through 'The Design Collective' What is your top fashion tip? Eliminate the non-
essentials, because less is always more Who is your muse? I always secretly raid things
from my mother's wardrobe, so she is my all-time muse Fashion prediction for next season?
the classic plaids and stripes are going to stick with us longer this time What is fashion
no- no ? All types and forms of synthetics Which designers/brands are you influenced by?
My current favourite is Eka by Rina Singh and Egg trading by Maureen Doherty. What’s the
best way to accessorise your clothes? Brogues are my solution to everything. Whether it’s
a pant-suit, a summer dress or even a saree, Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist

Jun 04 2019. Today I try out their new range of T Shirts, what I loved how simple the
designs were, and the fabric used was comfortable and extremely Sri Lankan friendly Inoma
and Fazil always believe in making the garment very simple yet sleek they have maintained
the same mantra with their new lineup of T-shirts, while you are at it - check out their
new Ramadan collection available online Always by local design and always support the
local designers and don’t forget to check out what 1331 has in store for you as the ladies
have a huge collection and the footwear range is a must try 1. You guys have introduced a
line up of T-shirt’s, why? And how did it start? We have always wanted to work on a Basics
range for both men and women, this is the first step! Since we don't have an extensive
range of products for men apart from the Shirts and leather footwear we decided to launch
the mens basic t-shirts first. We wanted to see how it would work for an online platform,
so excited to see how this goes! 2. The market is very crowded, how do you stand out? We
believe our designs are unique and we provide a personalised serviced. A lot of thought
goes into the selection of fabrics and we spend a lot of time working on the fit as we are
an online store and we want our customers to receive what they expect. We try to bring in
new products for our customers even though we are based online, we don't limit ourselves
to just one certain product with both Men and Womenswear. I believe that keeps us a part
from the rest. 3. Your brand has always been known for the fabric you guys use, how was it
to shop for the Tshirt Material? What did you guys keep in mind? Quality! A good garment
depends on its quality of material, fit and finish. We wanted to ensure the fabric would
fit all body types, not too clingy on the body or not too fine and to make sure it
wouldn't change its shape after a few washes. 4. Would you guys move into world wide
shipping? How has the feedback been globally? We have already started shipping worldwide!
So far we've shipped to Europe, Middle East, Australia and the Maldives and it has been
very humbling to receive positive feedback! 5. How often do you hope you bring out the
Tshirt collections? And would you be getting into print? This is our first collection so
we are going to see how this works, depending on feedback we will launch a collection
again soon. However our main focus right now is our flagship store and we want to have a
permanent Basics range. Hopefully once we have the store up and running we could do with
an exclusive range of t-shirts. 6. What skills according to you are necessary for a
successful fashion designer? Understanding of fabrics, how to bring your design to the
level of production, you could sketch anything but when it comes to the manufacturing
process one should be aware of how best to execute it and if it works for bulk production
managing time, an idea of how to run a business and how best to sell your product. 7. How
do you deal with an arrogant client out of the two of you who handles it better? We have a
team that handles all messages/calls, if there is anyone who wishes to speak to us, either
one of us available would take it. We ensure to handle it professionally, so no matter how
difficult the customer gets, we always reason well as the business depends on our
customers. 8. what’s the next new thing you hope to bring to the 1331 line up? Hopefully a
Ladies leatherwear range & Mens Loafers. 9. how can one get their hands on what’s
available? Via our Facebook page or Instagram. Our team is always prepared to get back to
any inquiries at all time and we are always available on our hotline! Danu is a Jaffna Boy

life_fashion90_8_Frok_enters_the_fashion_landscape.pdf,"Frok enters the fashion landscape
Mar 23 2021. A new contemporary fashion-forward online platform with a pragmatic and
conscious brand ethos is how CEO Natalie Jayasuriya describes her new fashion venture,
Frok. Natalie who traces her roots to the hospitality industry has now branched out into
fashion. A fashionista in her own right, what she lacks in terms of professional fashion
training she makes up for with experiences. Natalie has always had a finger on the fashion
pulse and has choreographed and organized numerous fashion shows. Speaking about her
target market, Natalie says “Frok has been designed to target a young demographic of 16
upwards. However, the products available on the site are for the perpetual youthful
whether it be female or male. She adds “Our platform which is www.frokme.com will offer a
mix of Frok signature designs and select collections from local designers who will
showcase their interpretation of the authentic FROK feel. We have also kept the price
points realistic with the maximum being Rs.10,000.” Very much a people person, speaking on
the online shopping experience that Frok will offer Natalie says “ Frok is completely
customer-centric. The customer will actually be able to reach out and speak to a member of
the Frok family who will assist them. We do not believe the future of e-commerce should be
devoid of the human element. For us, the human element is our strongest USP.” Speaking on
her vision for Frok, Natalie wants her venture to be the Sri Lankan hybrid of ASOS of
SHEIN. “ We want to support and market homegrown vendors and adapt to global trends to fit
within our cultural context. We also want to help young fashion designers to do what they
love and continue to design so that we can take care of the rest. Currently, we have a
range of 12 Sri Lankan designers and brands that we will sell online through Frok” she
added. Another important aspect that Natalie hopes her venture will contribute to is to
start regulating sizing for Sri Lankan apparel. She also hopes that by encouraging Sri
Lankans to shop for trendy, fashion-forward affordable products it will help keep revenue
within the country instead of channelling it overseas. Working with a team of highly
experienced and professionals ranging from manufacturing and secure payment gateway
partners to delivery and marketing personnel, Natalie hopes that Frok will lead the way
for online fashion retail. Your comment (*)",2446

fabric and trims. A designer who thinks out of the box, Lonali has always championed the
cause of recycling and upcyling and her brand has grown from strength to strength. Apart
from her ethical credentials her collections convey a social message too. What inspired

versatile collection. “Be you""; aims to inspire the youth to be the best version of

this collection? We have 20-25 styles that will create versatile and responsible looks.
Where do you source your fabrics and materials from? We use the discards from our apparel
industry. How many collections do you create per season/year? We do three collections per
year while doing sub-collections for accessories. This ensures we have new arrivals every
month. What differentiates your clothes from other designers? House of Lonali known for
its power of up-cycling, that is the key differentiator. We do this without compromising
on style. How ethically savvy do you think Sri Lankan fashion consumers are? We see a
clear increase in the uptake of ethical consumerism in Sri Lanka and this is a very good
sign for the country and the industry. What are the key themes you have concentrated on
for this collection? We have used a contemporary colour palette with shades of blue with a
hint of maroon and red for this collection. Silhouettes in this collection are trendy and
varies from straight to t shirts that can be tucked in or out. You will see a mix of
stripe and check fabrics across the collection with the most interesting being the double
cloth which we have used for reversible outfits. There is an array of both floral and
ethnic prints in some pieces that gives a chic metropolitan look if you pair it. Talk us
through your creative process We look for pre-consumer apparel discards from the industry
and based on these we develop products and styles to suit our consumers. Our inspiration
comes from people, places, aesthetics and the environment. These moments are then captured
in our collections. Wear responsibly and spread our story is what we advocate. Where do

Hon. John Amaratunga for Colombo Fashion Week 2017 I’m pleased to issue this message to
mark the 2017 edition of Colombo Fashion Week which I believe is the 14th consecutive show
to be held in Colombo. This event which has become an annual fixture in Sri Lanka’s events
calendar has over the years metamorphosed in to a high profile tourism attraction with a
global impact. Thanks to the vision of its founder, Colombo Fashion week is now one of the
biggest events held in Sri Lanka which showcases Sri Lankan fashion and creative
industries to the world. CFW has no doubt put this island paradise on the international
fashion map. More importantly it has helped attract the attention of the international
media to Sri Lanka, being the only lifestyle event shown globally which in turn has
brought positive rewards for the country’s tourism industry. Its novel concepts such as
the designer mentorship programs, retail presentations and Ethical Fashion Day have helped
carve out a special niche for the event. This year’s theme “Celebrate Colombo” will help
position Colombo as a vibrant city offering a diverse array of attractions for visitors.
It will consolidate Sri Lanka Tourism’s event based promotion strategy focusing on
bringing world class fashion and entertainment to the city of Colombo. I wish Colombo

Jun 26 2017. Inspiring, innovative and quite possibly the most influential design store in
town this Colombo 07 mecca is crammed with the most desirable labels. A modern yet
surprisingly warm and textural temple to the many, much-lusted-after collections housed in
this chic shopping enclave on Horton Place in Colombo 07, PR. The Colombo concept store by
Annika Fernando has everything a modern chic wardrobe needs. It is an interesting space to
shop and is arguably Colombo’s best-known luxury fashion destination with heaps of
emerging and established desirable names. Sri Lankan designers interspersed with an
interesting mix of international, mostly Indian, labels and one of the few places to find
fine and costume jewellery in a cool contemporary setting. Typical of her passion, Annika
has been casting her exacting eye over the collections since PR’s inception, editing them
to suit her loyal following. Her chic store showcases elegant and sophisticated ready-to-
wear pieces from home-grown labels like KT Brown and Sonali Dharmawardene, cutting-edge
pieces from young designers like Vathsala Gunasekera and Dinushi Pamanuwa’s La Pard,
classic-but-cool pieces from KUR, heavy hitting international names like Prayal Pratap and
Marysia. Exquisite jewellery and must have brass clutches from Papillon du and laid-back
offerings of off-duty staples from her own label MAUS to name just a few. The jewel in the
PR crown is its collaboration with and hosting of original designer trunk shows like
Shift, that engage consumers and add value to a fashion landscape where copycatting (or in
fashion speak being “inspired by”) has become tragically an all too common place, with its
victims mostly unaware that they are buying pieces which are essentially designer knock -
offs! Nimish Shah's label Shift is a favourite among Bollywood elite and fashion insiders,
like Sonam Kapoor (who attended) and his trunk show at PR last Saturday, which continues
in store, offers you a chance to explore why. Rumour has it that there's already a
waiting-list for key sold out pieces. Classic designs beautifully combined with quirky
detailing and stunning prints to create pieces that are both on trend and timeless.
Sophisticated and urban, chic separates are instilled with a sense of modernity to create
novel expressions. Only handpicked and specially commissioned artisan textiles that adhere
to stringent environmental and labour standards are used. Organic cotton and signature
textiles from master weavers create a collection of essentials, tops, dresses, light
jackets and hand knits that form the basis of the Shift collection. Designer Nimish Shah
graduated in Product Design and Development from the London College of Fashion. His stints
of work experience at fashion houses like Chloe and Burberry, and retailers like Browns
and Jigsaw continue to inform and influence his work. Shah works from Mumbai, and
champions an innovative approach to creating sustainable fashion products and services.
With its engaging aesthetic, well-conceived spaces and a focus on emerging talent and
sought after labels, this constantly evolving concept store has a fresh take on a
contemporary edit of desirable labels. If you’re looking to update your wardrobe, with
some always on-trend pieces and a mix of classics too, then PR at 41 Horton Place, Colombo
07 is essential shopping! Your comment (*)",3422

bodycon dress from Miss Selfridge, heels from H&M and watch from DKNY. Look 5 - Workout
For my workouts, I wear a crop sports top and leggings from Cotton On with Reebok shoes
and an Aldo watch. Style Role Model Oooh picking one is difficult but I would say it
ranges from Audrey Hepburn to Victoria Beckham, Miranda Kerr and Emma Watson. Favourite
Colours to Pair One monochromatic colour mixed with a pop of colour. I like an outfit that
isn’t too ‘loud’ but isn’t too dull at the same time. Style Must Haves? A versatile pair
of jeans A pair of comfortable but cute and dressy sandals. Make-up Tips? ‘Less is more’:
girls often think that caking their face in layers of make-up results in a flawless look
but in fact it’s quite the contrary. Letting the natural imperfections of your skin peek
through the make-up on your face is what leads to an overall natural yet beautiful make-up
look. Style Nos Definitely denim on denim and pattern mixing. I feel like it’s always
necessary to have a neutral piece in an outfit matched up with something out there. If
it’s too ‘loud’, it could potentially ruin the entire outfit. It’s also important to
understand that it’s not just wearing an outfit that makes being able to pull it off but
wearing it well. In this sense, pairing the appropriate undergarments with the right
outfit matters too. You cannot expect to pair a ‘bodycon’ dress with the wrong type of
underwear and expect to look amazing in that outfit, and I feel like that’s where a lot of
girls go wrong. Go To Outfit Definitely a pair of cute, comfortable shorts, with a preppy,
detailed top, my sunglasses, a pair of sandals/shoes and an over-the-shoulder bag. Style
Tip Dressing for your body-type and accentuating what’s best for your body-type. I’m 5
foot 0 inches tall and that makes me a pretty short girl. It’s important to remember that
what’s ‘in’ and latest in the fashion industry at the moment may not necessarily match
your body type and that’s completely fine! Learning to accentuate the high points of your
body accordingly, and understanding that what looks good on someone else may not
necessarily look as great on you. But regardless, that’s nothing to fret about! In this
humungous world of fashion that we live in, there’s definitely something suitable for
every type of body out there! Law Graduate, food and travel enthusiast and full time dog

life_fashion90_8_The_Decline_of_Logos_The_Rise_of_Quiet_Luxury_in_Asia.pdf,"The Decline of Logos: The Rise of Quiet Luxury in Asia
Aug 13 2024. In recent years, the luxury fashion landscape has undergone a significant
transformation. The once-dominant trend of conspicuous logos and overt branding is being
replaced by a more understated and refined approach known as “quiet luxury.” This shift is
particularly evident among big spenders in Asia, where the demand for subtlety and
sophistication is reshaping the industry. This article explores the decline of logos and
branding in luxury fashion and delves into the reasons behind the rise of quiet luxury in
Asia. The Era of Logo Mania For decades, luxury fashion was synonymous with bold logos and
prominent branding. Brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, and Chanel built their empires on
instantly recognizable monograms and logos that adorned everything from handbags to
clothing. These logos were not just symbols of status but also a way for consumers to
showcase their wealth and affiliation with high-end brands. However, as the luxury market
evolved, so did consumer preferences. The once-coveted logos began to lose their appeal,
and a new wave of luxury consumers emerged, seeking something different. The Rise of Quiet
Luxury Quiet luxury, also known as “stealth wealth” or “logo-free fashion,” is
characterized by its emphasis on quality, craftsmanship, and timeless design over overt
branding. This trend has gained traction among affluent consumers who value understated
elegance and exclusivity. Brands like The Row, Loro Piana, and Bottega Veneta have become
synonymous with quiet luxury, offering meticulously crafted pieces that speak volumes
without shouting their brand names. Several factors have contributed to the rise of quiet
luxury in Asia: Cultural Shifts: In many Asian cultures, humility and modesty are highly
valued traits. The ostentatious display of wealth through logos and branding can be seen
as gauche or inappropriate. As a result, affluent consumers in Asia are gravitating
towards brands that align with these cultural values, opting for subtlety and
sophistication. Influence of Pop Culture: The portrayal of wealthy characters in popular
media, such as the HBO series “Succession,” has played a significant role in popularizing
quiet luxury. Characters in these shows often wear impeccably tailored, logo-free
clothing, setting a new standard for what it means to be stylish and wealthy.
Sustainability and Ethical Considerations: Modern luxury consumers are increasingly
concerned about sustainability and ethical practices. Brands that prioritize quality over
quantity and focus on sustainable production methods are gaining favor. Quiet luxury
brands often emphasize their commitment to craftsmanship and sustainability, resonating
with environmentally conscious consumers. Desire for Exclusivity: In a world saturated
with mass-produced luxury goods, true exclusivity has become a rare commodity. Quiet
luxury offers a sense of exclusivity that logo-heavy brands cannot match. The absence of
logos allows consumers to feel like they are part of an exclusive club, known only to
those who appreciate the finer details. Economic Factors: Economic fluctuations and
uncertainties have also influenced consumer behavior. During times of economic
instability, consumers tend to gravitate towards timeless, investment-worthy pieces rather
than trendy, logo-driven items. Quiet luxury aligns perfectly with this mindset, offering
pieces that can be cherished for years to come. The Impact on Luxury Brands The shift
towards quiet luxury has forced traditional luxury brands to rethink their strategies.
Brands that once relied heavily on logos and branding are now exploring more subtle
approaches. For example, Burberry has toned down its iconic check pattern, and Gucci has
introduced more minimalist designs alongside its signature logo-heavy pieces. This
transition is not without its challenges. Brands must strike a delicate balance between
maintaining their identity and adapting to changing consumer preferences. Some brands have
successfully navigated this shift, while others are still finding their footing. The
Future of Luxury Fashion As the demand for quiet luxury continues to grow, it is likely
that more brands will embrace this trend. The focus on quality, craftsmanship, andsustainability is not just a passing fad but a reflection of evolving consumer values.
Luxury fashion is becoming less about ostentation and more about authenticity and
substance. In Asia, where cultural values and economic factors play a significant role in
shaping consumer behavior, the rise of quiet luxury is expected to have a lasting impact.
Brands that can adapt to these changing preferences and offer products that resonate with
the modern luxury consumer will thrive in this new era. The decline of logos and branding
in luxury fashion and the rise of quiet luxury in Asia represent a significant shift in
the industry. This trend is driven by cultural values, pop culture influences,
sustainability concerns, and a desire for exclusivity. As luxury brands navigate this
evolving landscape, those that prioritise quality, craftsmanship, and authenticity will
continue to capture the hearts of discerning consumers. A fashion stylist with a decade of

life_fashion90_8_What_is_your_skin_colours_season_A_look_into_personal_colour.pdf,"What is your skin colour’s season? A look into personal colour analysis
Jul 02 2024. “Maybe you should go for the black dress instead of purple, everyone looks
great in black!” Not really. If you’ve taken a look at the latest fashion trends soaring
over social media in the past year, you would know that the resurgence of the term
personal colour analysis proves that statement to be false. Personal colour analysis is an
intricate system that guides individuals to take their hair, skin tone and other facial
features into consideration to curate the perfect colour combinations to help them look
their best by enhancing their natural features. Be it a physicist, philosopher or artist,
humans have been familiar with colour theories for centuries. By extensively studying how
light interacts with colour and our sight, we have managed to put together various
theories to explore how things work. A similar pattern is understood when it comes to
sound and music. We are bound to enjoy hearing a few notes that were curated carefully,
compared to listening to dissonant chords that sound off-key. Notice that the core idea in
these two cases is harmony. A harmonious colour combination, if that is between colours or
with a specific skin tone, appears to be visually pleasing. However, if a colour is of a
jarring note, it would appear to have the opposite effect and in the context of someone’s
appearance would leave them looking unhealthy or sluggish. The first colour analysts were
artists, working to figure out ways to achieve a harmonious colour palette in between the
subject’s surroundings, outfit and skin and hair tones. In the 1920s, one particular
artist named Johannes Itten developed a colour theory that associated colour palettes with
types of people and seasons. Afterwards, another artist, Robert Dorr, translated this
theory into a practical analysis and categorised individuals under warm and cool tones. By
the 1980s, as research and development improved, so did the various dye analysis drapes
and makeup which eventually led to the establishment of colour analysis companies that
provided professional analysis sessions, primarily to entertainment sectors. To determine
your personal colour palette, you would first have to identify your personal colour
season. Various colour type systems exist, but the basics stand with Spring Warm, Summer
Cool, Autumn Warm and Winter Cool. Spring Warm: Those who fall into this category are
typically light-skinned, with a golden undertone. Their eyes are light to medium in
darkness and are usually shades of clear blue, bright green, hazel or light grey. This
colour palette consists of golden yellows, rich oranges, warm greens and soft pastels with
an overall warmth and bright energy surrounding them. Including these spring colours
brings about a radiant glow to their complexion, giving it a refreshing and youthful
appearance. For makeup, they might have to include earthy tones and peachy blushes to
complement their skin tone. Colours to avoid with this palette are cool purple, bright
pink, deep blue and black. Summer Cool: Those with a very light to medium tan skin tone,
ashy blonde hair or dark ash brown hair, and eyes that have a grey undertone, are
categorised under summer cool. This colour palette features cool blues, mild purple and
pink, with a touch of soft grey. These colours are meant to emit a sense of serenity
representing a cool summer breeze, that settles itself gracefully on these individuals and
brightens their complexion. When it comes to makeup, foundations with cooler undertones,
and lipsticks in soft pinks and mauves are optimum. Colours to avoid with the palette are
bright orange and warm brown. Autumn Warm: People in this category can be of a warm light,
medium or dark skin tone and their hair will usually have a golden, reddish or brown hint
of colour paired with darker warmer eyes like hazel, amber or golden brown. The colours of
this palette evoke a rich sense of earthiness and warmth by including muted orange, warm
red and olive green. Wearing these colours can add depth to their complexion, giving it a
warm sunlit appearance. Bronze shades for eyeshadow and blushes in warm hues are best for
this colour palette. However, beware of pastel colours, bright white and black. Winter
Cool: Individuals with a cool, light, medium, and dark skin tone, along with hair colourssuch as dark brown, black-brown and black, belong in this category. They also have eyes
that are cool-toned in shades of hazel, dark brown or black. This palette includes royal
blue, emerald green, and bold shades of purple representing elegance, contrast and
intensity. Winter individuals usually have a much higher contrast between their features
than other colour seasons and so, these deep colours aid in lightening their complexion
giving it a cool and radiant appearance. For makeup, eyeshadow in cool neutral colours and
lipsticks in bold shades would best enhance their features. Try to stray from colours like
yellow, pastel pink and warm brown. To determine your personal colour season, you might
need to make a few observations. Are your veins more blue than green on the inside of your
wrist? If they are, you may find yourself in summer cool or winter cool. Do you feel like
your skin stands out when you slip on a silver bracelet or gold ring? If silver seems to
look more compatible with your skin, you might be cool-toned. Otherwise, you might lean
towards a warmer colour palette. Lastly, think about the last time you went out in the
sun. Did your skin tan easily or give you a harsh sunburn? If your skin accepts a golden
tan, you might favour warmer tones. However, if you find your skin burning, you may align
with cool colour palettes. It is common for people with darker skin tones to be mistyped
easily as an Autumn or Winter season due to their darker features (eyes or hair), and many
people of colour, including Sri Lankans may struggle to find where they belong in this
context. Contrary to what the system promotes, as it was predominantly meant for the West,
some colours under these respective seasons tend to wash out individuals of a darker skin
tone, making them look unappealing and tired. Therefore, it is important to keep in mind
that a thorough observation is done before determining your personal colour season,
whether it was carried out by a specialist or by yourself. As Sri Lankans, our skin tones
belong to a darker shade, however, the same may not apply to our features. It is possible
for us to belong to a Spring Warm or Summer Cool category when taking other features such
as lip colour into account. A simple but fool-proof way to determine your colour season is
the lipstick test. By testing as many colours and shades on yourself and using a guide to
trace which season those specific colours belong to, you would’ve found your answer.
Sahana Kargi and Monica Ravichandran are two of the biggest social media influencers who
regularly post content that focuses on darker brown skin tones, educating South Asian
communities on colour palettes, and makeup and reinforcing positivity around these topics
inviting the sunkissed public to venture on their own colour journeys. The goal of
identifying your own colour palette is to enhance your natural beauty and boost your
confidence, allowing you to look good and feel the part. If you still like wearing that
bright yellow shirt from 5 years ago, who’s to stop you? Wearing a smile in your favourite
outfit is sometimes your most flattering look! Your comment (*)",7553

life_fashion90_9_ALVIN-_Street_Style.pdf,"ALVIN- Street Style
Sep 14 2017. Alvin describes his street style as ‘Minimalist and androgynous inspired by
costumes’. A sense of fashion derived by sentiment towards the places he’s been and the
people he’s met, Alvin’s style is never restricted by the latest trends. “Coming from a
thespian and hospitality background filled with a lot of creativity, I’ve not really had a
fear in how I look in my clothes. Trial and error certainly was a huge part of my fashion
sense but it evolved with my personality and it was always an expression of how I felt.”
Look 1 Travel Travel is a huge part of who I am. Living in different countries and being
exposed to so many cultures and styles, I love to dress in a way that expresses all of it.
For this particular outfit, I went with a custom made Agent menswear shirt in light olive
green by Shanika Sammarakody with peek-a-boo detailing in the front, paired with severely
ripped acid wash jeans, brogue hand dyed boots from Melbourne Florsheim DFO, and for those
cold flights and winters back home in Melbourne I threw on a black knotted cape and bowler
hat from my online bae ASOS. As for concealing those eye bags from the jet lag, I use my
Burberry shades.No man can go wrong travelling with a good trusty carry on luggage and
I’ve got my Issey Miyake carry on from the 2006 collection in ash blue. Look 2 Day My
daily go-to outfit is something slightly less extreme in comparison to my extremely detail
oriented outfit. I’ve opted for an oversized light vintage denim shirt from Polo Ralph
Lauren along with a ripped salmon pink jeans from Religion, AUS. My main item for daily
use is my tote bag from Envoy Mansion, LK and to beat the daring sun, my Burberry shades
gifted to me from Cannes. And to complete the outfit a bit of jewellery from Lovisa,
Melbourne along with white loafers from Cotton on. I’ve braided my hair up for a heat
friendly all day style. Look 3 Evening I love events around this time frame cause I like
to play around with my look and it’s always a no holds barred kinda feeling when I let my
imagination run wild and it’s always a conversation starter. For this look I paired two
pieces from two different suits, a customer made forest green blazer and houndstooth
trousers from Agent Menswear along with a white shirt by O:live Couture and black suede
brogue wing tips from Zara Man, Melbourne. Yet again I can never be seen without my bag
cause I’m that guy so I’ve paired one of my favourite clutches in black crocodile leather
from ZARA Man, Perth. And for jewellery, I’ve used a statement ring from a rock which I
found on a beach in Melbourne and was made into a ring by a friend of mine. Look 4 Night
out Who doesn't love going out with a bunch of your best mates? This particular outfit is
very special as it was carefully designed and made specially for my best friends 21st
birthday, and when it comes to friends, everything goes! This outfit is a pure white
plunging neckline jumpsuit and Japanese inspired kimono dramatic coat by Agent Menswear
paired with brown leather gladiator sandals by ASOS Melbourne (because who doesn't love
looking good and feeling comfortable while getting trashed and dancing the night away?)
For the jewellery I've gone a bit crazy a with a reptile inspired ear cuff in dull gold by
Colette, Melbourne along with statement hand accessories from Lovisa and my snakeskin
clutch from Envoy mansion, LK. For my hair I’ve put extensions in and voila! a bigger
fuller topknot! Look 5 Beachwear Yet again another great trip and some of the best
memories for me involve impromptu trips along the Melbourne coast with my best mates and
we all love to simple have fun and be comfortable... all expect me, cause I’m the guy that
can be counted on to wear something a little too expensive, but style is style and that’s
me. For this look I’ve thrown on a piece of beach shorts in teal by Marcuse, AUS together
with my most comfortable, hand dyed shirt from G by Gihan Ediriweera paired with black
suede tie ups by 22:02 by Heshan. I’ve kept it much simpler with accessories wearing one
half of a friendship chain by Lovisa, Melbourne. Style Role Model So many to choose from
but to mention a few would be, David Bowie and Gaga for their outrageous unapologetic
style choices. Hubert de Givenchy, for his statement that being undressed is your onlysin, never fear being the best dressed man in the room and of course Andre Leon Talley.
Favourite Colours to Pair I'm not an huge colour fan. I like to keep my colours very
rustic and nude and minimalist. Occasionally throw in a bit of bold colours. I stick to
tans, blacks and whites, earth tones and simple patterns. Go To Outfit If it's a normal
day, then a good pair of jeans can never fail you, so I always invest in a good pair of
jeans, along with a shirt or tee with some form of statement, either cut outs or having an
accent tones that makes it different. My black tote bag and shades are my go-to and no
matter what, I don't leave the house without a ring so I feel a little dressed up, and a
matching pair of shoes. Style Must Have’s A good pair or jeans: In a few shades for
different occasions (professional, casual, and fashion forward) A good cologne because
it's subtle, but an absolute must! A good bag with you at all times and I don't mean the
old times briefcases or a backpack made for school goers, but a carry on or a clutch to
help with all those documents and daily items we require. Maintain your hair and groom
well cause it really pulls a look together no matter what. No one can resist a good head
of hair, trust me, I know! Invest in a good pair of underwear! That fits well, helps keep
everything where it should be and it won't peak through your garments, the looser the
undergarment then it all shows through those dress pants. Find the right fit and it'll
help through out the day and if all else fails, you'll at-least be doing your significant
other a pleasant favour. Make up tip For the darker guys out there like me, we know the
struggle. So don't shy away from using a thin layer of tinted foundation and some powder
which is more than enough, let's leave the contouring and highlighting to the ladies.

about a 6 year old named Bella, who shares her experiences as she goes on an adventure to
parents and classmates with the hope of giving students, siblings, teachers and other
adults a better understanding of what goes through a child's mind living with autism and
shares reasons for some of her behaviours. She also established a Q & A session called

Oct 05 2021. Relocating from New York to Colombo has seen the founder of Lois London,
Radhika Perera Hernandez’s brand grow exponentially. Boasting a healthy global customer
base, Radhika’s success story is admirable. Traditionally, Lois London’s collections have
been aimed at those with slim and lithe figures. Her cleverly draped slinky silhouettes
held together with strategically placed spaghetti straps and ties made the wearer look
like a lissome goddess. In her new collection recently unveiled on her Instagram the image
of a plus-size model beautifully sporting one of her creations shattered the hitherto held
myth that Lois London dresses were only for those with pert breasts, washboard stomachs,
and towering heights! Stepping out with a mindset that embraces inclusivity the new Lois
London collection is not only aimed at those plus-sized customers with voluptuous figures
but those who favour gender fluid clothing. Despite our reticence in admitting and
accepting it - we do have a growing community of crossdressers, many driven underground by
the narrowminded attitudes of society. For them, the fact that Radhika used a male model
to showcase her new collection is not only empowering but has put a taboo subject in the
spotlight. What sparked your interest in fashion design? The desire to express myself and
create an identity through style. Hand making my own clothes was a creative outlet for me.
What made you take fashion more seriously and make a career out of it? Moving to New York
and seeing so many young individuals making a career for themselves in fashion was very
inspiring, it actually seemed attainable for the first time in my life. Are you self
taught or did you study fashion design? I’m self-taught. Your signature style is free-
flowing silhouettes. Have you been tempted to veer away from that aesthetic? There are
some form-fitted silhouettes in each collection but I tend to gravitate to a looser and
more relaxed fit. Are there any types of clothing that you avoid designing? Things that
feel a bit too constricted, especially in stiff fabrics. Where do you look for creative
inspiration? Everywhere from textiles to home decor. I’m forever browsing on Pinterest.
Describe your latest collection? An earth-toned capsule in rich hues of rust and amber
which layer perfectly for fall or can be worn alone for a special occasion. The collection
as always has convertible silhouettes and this season we have focused on more crepe driven
fabrics. Who is your muse? It varies from season to season. I don’t have just one. What
are your sustainability credentials? We proudly use upcycled market sourced goods for
certain styles in each collection which enables us to have an impact on the fashion’s
carbon footprint. What are you fascinated by at the moment and how does it feed into your
work? Developing more techniques used frequently in Sri Lanka like batik, handloom, and
natural dyeing. What is the biggest lesson that you have learned since you started your
company? Don’t give up, persevere and keep getting better. Your new collection caters to
plus size. What made you include plus sizes? We have always catered to plus size. From the
inception, our dresses were free size and could fit 0-16 U.S. In fact, we showcased a
plus-size model back in 2015, but the return of that representation in our campaigns is
long overdue. What role do you think social media plays in fashion today? Everything, you
can build a brand just on social media alone. What is your favourite part about being a
designer? The positive feedback from my customers. How do you want women to feel when
wearing your clothes? Confident. You have used Shan to model your clothes, how important
is inclusivity and catering to gender-fluid customers? I want to create something that
makes the wearer feel special, regardless of gender, race, size, etc. Inclusivity has been
something I’ve felt passionately about since the beginning and I’m excited to see these
boundaries being broken. Tina Edward Gunawardhana is a journalist specialising in travel,

life_fashion90_9_Fashionably_Danu_-_Gitano_Shirts.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu - Gitano Shirts
Apr 04 2017. This week I break into a pool of colour with Gitano Shirts, made by this sun
loving man called Gayashan Wijayasinghe. He says ""Danu, everyone needs a loud shirt!"", so
they kept it very island loving. Although this is inspired by Sri Lanka, this brand has
already touched the international market. It is a Dubai based collection of men's shirts
inspired by adventure, waves and jungle fever! These shirts come in a range of loud and
unique designs - perfect for any beach day, party and BBQ and on the day you decide to
quit your day job, wear it to work and kiss your boss goodbye. It's a fun brand and its
perfect for our little island, and we had a great time shooting this collection at
Bunkyard Hostels. What's unique about this range of shirts? Gitano Shirts are of a loose
fit and are lightweight. They are made in eye-catching, stylish designs and the materials
that we use are carefully chosen to create a smooth and comfortable feel. Ideal for warm
days and nights, with your toes in the sand and a drink in your hand. Our shirts are worn
and loved by both men and women, and everyone enjoys the relaxed feel of a Gitano Shirt!
What are you inspired by when you design a collection? Our shirts are inspired by
adventure, waves and jungle fever. We name each shirt design after our favourite spots
that we have travelled to around the world - for example, Zicatela, Bells Beach, Arugam
Bay. What do you want the wearer to feel when they are in your designs? Our shirts provide
the wearer with a sense of confidence and comfort. We have a limited number of shirts made
in each design, giving our customers a 'one of a kind' feel to our products. You have this
brand retailing in a few countries. What has the customer feedback been like - overseas
and in Sri Lanka? Our shirts have been distributed in Australia, the UK, Dubai (UAE) and
now we are launching our range here in Sri Lanka. The response to Gitano everywhere has
been overwhelming! We often hear comments back from our happy customers abroad, telling us
that their purchase is the ""most comfortable shirt"" that they have ever owned. Tell me
about the brand name. The name Gitano means 'gypsy' in Spanish. The idea came to us while
travelling in Mexico and trying to speak the lingo last year before starting the brand.
Where do you see yourself in the future? Starting an online store to ship worldwide and
handle the larger orders. We also plan on opening a small boutique clothing shop for
Gitano here on the island. Would you guys be trying out new things with the brand, apart
from the shirts? The dream would be starting on custom designed board shorts and singlets.
In which part of the world is the brand most popular in? The majority of our orders
currently come from Australia and the UK. Once our online store opens up there will be
worldwide distribution of Gitano Shirts. Where can one buy it in Sri Lanka? A range of our
shirts can be found at the fresh new Bunkyard Hostels , on Guildford Crescent, Colombo 7!
For all our current designs check out our pages on Instagram and Facebook . For any
inquiries please contact us at gitanoshirts@gmail.com. Speaking to the man with the
creative eye, Arantha, who is now a proud owner of this shirt too... What do you think
about this summer collection? The Gitano summer collection looks very vibrant. I must make
note of the material they have used for the shirts as they are so tropicalized. It's a
great buy if you're a person who wants to wear something hip to go to the beach or spend
some time outdoors. Do you feel that Sri Lankans would like to be seen in them? Sri
Lankans should definitely wear them as they are so comfortable. What are your thoughts on
resortwear in Sri Lanka for men? There are a very few brands which do resortwear for men
in Sri lanka. I guess Sri Lankan designers should concentrate on that more. Designer:

life_fashion90_9_Fashionably_Danu_Featuring__-_1331.pdf,"Fashionably, Danu Featuring - 1331
Oct 02 2018. Today on Fashionably Danu, I feature 1331 a brand that has always kept to
great quality and perfecting their look. The collection featured is super friendly, yet
smart with fabrics that make you feel comfortable and trendy. This is my first feature
with them for 2018 and wanted to know what’s trending with the brand. How often do you
guys bring out a new collection, and how long does it remain in production? We introduce a
collection once in 3 months, we have 4 collections released each year. If a product is
doing really well and we have requests to bring it back in stock, provided the
availability of fabric we remake another batch. Product development and manufacturing is
usually a continuous operation and a collection takes about 1-2 months for completion.
1331 introduced footwear into your line up, how is going and would you guys move into
shoes soon? The feedback has been great and humbling. We are currently looking into shoes
as well. Developing footwear takes a bit of time so we are looking to introduce shoes when
we open our flagship store. As for now, we are based online and we believe in order to
purchase the perfect pair of shoes that fit, the facility to fit it on is a must, so we
are keeping this on hold! Tell me about the items you have featured on me today? We have
featured some of our best sellers on you today! These shirts show our style and uniqueness
that sets us apart from other Menswear Brands. The Onyx Shirt which is the Black and white
panelled shirt, is one of our new products that took a bit of time perfecting the finish,
we are all about stripes and polka dots this year and we also introduced our linen
collection, some of which you're wearing today like the Khaki Shirt. How do you guys work
on the designs, and who makes the final call? We are both constantly on the lookout for
fresh and new styles, we look at anything that inspires us and works on current trends
together to create the final product. Who would you say is your biggest clientele, men or
women? It’s a good balance of both but our menswear is more popular, because of the
limited options available in Colombo. Can you also customize designs on request?
Currently, we customize for women on request, we are yet to start custom made orders for
men. Choosing fabric is a big issue in this country, and how do you guys work around it?
Yes, it is definitely the most challenging part of the job. We have very limited options
for good fabric and most of the time we have to settle for what is available which is a
bit frustrating. We hand pick each fabric we chose and we pretty much scan all the fabric
shops and suppliers and we work with a few fabric importers but still, you’d have another
brand using the same fabric which is unavoidable. What would you say is the next step for
1331? We want THIRTEEN.THIRTYONE to be brand led, and manufacture all items under our
brand name. We will be releasing our Basics Collection in the near future for both Men and
Women. We are also thinking of expanding our Leatherwear line by next year. What would be
the men’s best seller with the new collection? The best seller this time would be the
Nautical Shirt, which we couldn’t feature on you today as it is almost sold out in less
than a month! Where do you guys position your brand? And would there be a 1331 store soon?
Yes, we are! Right now our main focus is to work towards opening our store, we initially
wanted THIRTEEN.THIRTYONE to be only based online, but due to popular demand and to offer
our customers a better shopping experience we are hoping to launch our flagship store soon
while operating our online store. Co-Founders & Designers – Inoma & Fazil Photographer –

Aug 11 2019. Day 3 of the OLU Swim Week Colombo took place at the Shangri – La Hotel
Colombo. 8 designers, both local and international, took to the runway showcasing a
multitude of swim and resort wear in vivacious colours and clean-cut designs. With sleek
silhouettes, bursts of colour and flirty designs, OLU Swim Week Colombo wrapped up in
style. Indian label EKA reflects designer Rina Singh’s design philosophy of simple living
with soulful clothing that makes way for individual expression. The collection featured
dream-like, sleek silhouettes made with free-flowing materials of cotton and linen in
subtle pastel shades of blue and pink. Leading menswear designer Fouzal Hameed wowed with
his collection of menswear in shades of crisp white and blue. Perfect for a cruise in the
sea or exploring ancient cities the collection was both functional and stylish. Peronie
Stefel Returning to the catwalk after hiatus of a few seasons, Peronie presented a
visually stunning collection of fabulous designs. Inspired by vintage flowers and
butterflies, Peronie had painstakingly created fabric with intricately detailed designs of
butterflies and flowers that were utterly breathtaking. Peronie has fused western floral
designs with an ancient Sri Lankan artisanal technique to great effect. Nivedita Saboo
Celebrity designer Nivedita Saboo presented a couture resort wear collection that bore
testament to her 17 years in the fashion industry. Having showcased at Paris Fashion Week
and Hong Kong and London Bridal Week, Nivedita made her debut at Swim Week Colombo with an
ensemble that was relaxed, sensual and global. Deriving inspiration from the sharp, edgy
and luxurious facets of jewels and crystals she presented a collection that fused
crystalline geometric prints with flowy silhouettes. Dramatic ruffles, pleats, plunging
necklines and halter necks were a few key features of her visually stunning collection.
Wendell Rodricks Indian designer Wendell Rodricks dug into his Goan roots and its culture
to present a collection inspired by marine and coral life. From swimwear to beach sarongs,
coverups to cocktail dresses his collection ranged from subdued pastels to electric
colours of pink, blue and yellow. Bold cuts, multicolor and sheer fabric layering defined
the style of his ensemble. Titling her collection femme fierce Rukshi Fernando sent
ensembles that were rich in print and colour. One pieces swimsuits bikinis formed part of
her collection which packed a punch. With powerful prints, contrast detailing and dynamic
styling, her resort wear embraced the island spirit. Inspired by the monsoon season
Sharmila Ruberu's ‘Mystical Monsoon’ collection was in hues of green black and sienna.
Asymmetrical hemlines on free-flowing silhouettes were accentuated with some stunning
accessories. The finale for Day 3, Australian label Aqua Blu presented their collection
‘Eden’ in celebration of colour and nature. With white and blue as its central colours,
the collection embodied style, modernity and femininity with edgy swimsuits and lounge
wear. The label’s finale one piece with embedded jewels was a dazzling end to the star-
studded show. By: Tina Edward Gunawardhana and Panchali Illankoon Your comment (*)",3260
life_fashion90_9_Pulling_Off_White__-_Style_tips_from_Sithmi_Gamalath_of_WHIT.pdf,"Pulling Off White - Style tips from Sithmi Gamalath of WHITE
Jul 25 2017. The designer and brainchild of the label WHITE by SG , Sithmi Gamalath is
someone who embraces the colour of purity, peace and character. However, this is not her
only reason for initiating a brand with only white clothing. The task of running around
Colombo to find white on white outfits that matched from head to toe was a disappointing
task for Sithmi. This disappointment was the perfect reason for her to create her own
clothing label. The design process meets the founder’s vision to create garments that
juxtapose structure and geometry with feminine undertones while also guaranteeing the
style staying power. Their concepts and products bring out the minimalistic, timeless and
sublime nature of art forms. ‘’White is a timeless colour that suits anyone and suits any
occasion,’’ says Sithmi. Being an instant magnet to classics and evolving timeless
patterns, art forms and creations, it is no surprise that Sithmi’s label, WHITE resonates
with conservative and timeless designs that reflect much of our Sri Lankan culture. The
next collection they are working on is dedicated to the ‘petite her’. Since the first
collection entailed a mix of casuals and occasion wear items using fabrics such as linen,
cotton, silk, lace and velvet, the upcoming creations will revolve around the casual,
occasion and resort wear with a focus on a variety of designs and few comforting fabric
choices No colour is fresher or crisp than white. So when you wear this hue from head to
toe, it results in an exceptionally stylish, high impact look. Rocking an all white outfit
is not easy. To give you the confidence to pull off an all white outfit, here are some
style tips that Sithmi Gamalath shared with us. Opt for natural beauty White is a powerful
and eye catching colour and doesn’t need a lot of accentuating. It is no secret that white
is as versatile as it gets. Simply because white goes with everything, don’t overdo it.
You can add some edge to your look by incorporating statement pieces to your all white
look. If I am wearing an all white look that is simple and pretty, I’d like to give it an
edge with dark lips. Keep it minimal I always like to think less is more! You probably
know that by now so keep these busy bracelets, necklaces and rings to a minimum. Wear
nude/tan pants and bra It is not pleasant to be sporting white jeans on top of coloured or
printed innerwear. Even a white bra can be visible through white clothes. Wearing
skin/nude inner wear will avoid this fashion mishap. Wear flats or sneakers White
instantly elevates and dresses up your look because I personally think the right tone of
white worn with confidence would look good on anyone. So dress your look down based on the
occasion. Choose wisely Classy and sophisticated is the only way to go with all white
outfits. Light accessories and light makeup is key. However, if you’re daring, you can opt
for a bolder look with a dash of colour that instantly gives white a stylish direction.
The less going on, the more the white outfit turns into a statement piece itself, and the
more heads you will turn. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. SG's WHITE collection

life_fashion90_9_Samitha_Wijayasekara_Redefining_Floristry_Through_Art_Fashio.pdf,"Samitha Wijayasekara: Redefining Floristry Through Art, Fashion, and Innovation
Nov 26 2024. Samitha Wijayasekara, a seasoned floral designer and entrepreneur, brings
over 15 years of expertise to her business, The Wedding Flowers Gallery (Pvt) Ltd., based
in Mirihana, Nugegoda. She recently presented an innovative collection of floral wearable
art at the WCIC Ramp Up 2025. At 52, Samitha combines a strong foundation in finance,
thanks to her professional qualification from AAT, with an impressive portfolio of
international floral design training. She has honed her craft under renowned floral
masters such as Wendy Andrade, Damien Koh, Gregor Lersch, Pirjo Koppi, and Hitomi Gilliam,
attending workshops that span advanced wiring techniques, innovative bridal designs, and
creative craftsmanship. Since founding The Wedding Flowers Gallery in 2008, Samitha has
become a sought-after name in Sri Lanka's wedding industry, known for her exceptional
creativity and attention to detail. From modern bridal designs to personal flowers-to-
wear, her work reflects a perfect blend of artistry and elegance, making every special
occasion truly unforgettable. Q Can you share the story of how you got into floral art and
what inspired you to pursue it as a career? My journey into floral art started
unexpectedly. I initially pursued a career in accountancy which later transitioned into
horticulture. Growing up, I was always captivated by the intricate beauty of flowers, and
I began exploring them as a hobby. Over time, I realized that floristry wasn’t just about
making beautiful arrangements- it was about telling a story and evoking emotions. In 2008,
I embarked on my own journey as a floral designer by establishing The Wedding Flowers,
where I assisted clients with wedding planning, corporate events, and banquets. As demand
grew, the business moved to a new office in 2010, becoming what is now known as The
Wedding Flowers Gallery (Pvt) Ltd. Driven by an undying passion for flowers, I developed a
strong reputation in the industry, earning the honour of becoming the first Sri Lankan
member of the World Flower Council in 2015. The company is supported by years of
expertise, self-confidence, and international exposure through participation in various
global training programmes, including the introduction of the Wearable Art technique to
Sri Lanka. Q What are the qualifications or training programmes you have attended with
regard to floral artistry? My qualifications in floral artistry include a certificate
course from the Nobleman School of Floral Designing in Singapore, complemented by
extensive training under internationally renowned floral designers. I have completed
Advanced Wiring Techniques with Wendy Andrade, Designing Fundamentals and Innovative
Techniques with Damien Koh, and a workshop on Principles, Craftsmanship, and Creativity
led by Gregor Lersch. Additionally, I specialized in Personal Flowers-to-Wear and Modern
Bridal Floral Design with Pirjo Koppi and participated in the International Floral
Workshop ‘Winter Celebration’ with Hitomi Gilliam. These experiences have equipped me with
a broad range of skills and innovative techniques in floral design. Q What inspired your
collection of wearable floral art showcased at WCIC Ramp Up 2024? The Wearable Floral Art
collection is inspired by the beauty of nature and the variety of human experiences. Each
piece reflects the colours, textures, and shapes found in the natural world, celebrating
how fashion and nature can work together. The idea behind this collection was to create
floral art that could be worn and appreciated as part of fashion while maintaining a focus
on sustainability. Q Why did you choose fresh flowers and the wire technique as the
foundation for your designs? As a nature lover, I’ve always been inspired by the vibrant
colours and textures that flowers offer. Fresh flowers bring an authenticity and natural
beauty that I feel are essential for creating truly unique pieces. By using fresh flowers,
I can celebrate the richness of nature’s palette and incorporate those natural colours
into trendy fashion. The wire technique helps me sculpt and structure the flowers,
allowing me to create wearable art that is not only beautiful but also eco-friendly. I
want my designs to reflect my love for nature. Q How did your collaboration with fashiondesigner Charith Wijesekera come about, and what was the creative process like? Charith
and I are both part of Sri Lanka’s bridal industry, and we’ve always been interested in
creating something different from traditional designs. My collaboration with Charith
Wijesekara came about through a shared appreciation for blending art with nature. We both
saw an opportunity to combine his expertise in fashion design with my background in floral
artistry to create something unique. The creative process was a truly collaborative one.
We started by discussing the concept of merging fashion and florals in a way that felt
both innovative and wearable. Together, we experimented with different types of flowers,
fabrics, and wire techniques to create pieces that could move with the body while also
showcasing the delicate beauty of fresh blooms. It was a balance of creativity and
practicality. While Charith focused on the design elements, I worked on incorporating
flowers in a way that enhanced the overall look without overwhelming the piece. Using
wire, I was able to create floral structures that could be attached seamlessly to the
fabric, allowing the flowers to frame the body in a way that felt organic and sculptural.
Q What challenges did you face in crafting wearable floral art, particularly with the use
of fresh flowers? Crafting wearable floral art with fresh flowers presented several
challenges. The biggest challenge I faced was definitely timing. Since I was working with
fresh flowers, they needed to be put together right before the event to ensure they stayed
fresh and vibrant. I had to create 10 pieces, which meant I was working under a tight
deadline. The process of designing, arranging, and attaching the flowers to the wire
structures took time, and I had to set everything up at the last minute to make sure the
flowers looked their best. Managing all of this while keeping the pieces durable and
wearable for the show was definitely the toughest part. Q How do you ensure the
practicality and durability of your floral pieces during showcases or events? To ensure
the durability of my floral pieces, I treat the flowers and foliage before using them.
This helps preserve their freshness and longevity, allowing them to stay vibrant
throughout the event. I also carefully select flowers that are known for their long-
lasting qualities, ensuring they can withstand the demands of a runway show. Additionally,
I make sure the flowers are as fresh as possible when I begin working with them, so they
maintain their beauty and integrity during the event. Q Can you share the significance of
the flowers used in the collection and why you selected them? I began with a mood board
and selected 10 different designs and colour palettes. After discussing the clothing with
the fashion designer, I chose flowers to complement the dresses. I used classic blooms
like roses, orchids, and baby’s breath, and also added striking seasonal flowers like
Gloriosa and Heliconia for their dramatic shapes. Amaranthus was included for its unique
hanging effect, adding movement and texture. Each flower was carefully selected to create
a balanced, vibrant look that complemented the fashion. Q How do you see wearable floral
art, like your creations, influencing the future of floristry and fashion? Wearable floral
art offers a unique, eco-friendly option for weddings, parties, events, and photoshoots.
Instead of traditional bouquets, clients can wear flowers or opt for hand corsages,
creating personalized, standout pieces. This trend not only provides something fresh and
unique but also promotes sustainability by using locally sourced, fresh flowers, helping
reduce waste and benefiting the planet. Q As the proprietor of The Wedding Flowers Gallery
Pvt Ltd., how do you balance commercial floral design with such innovative artistic
projects? At The Wedding Flowers Gallery, we mainly focus on large weddings and events,
which require a lot of attention to detail. Balancing this with my artistic projects like
wearable floral art comes down to good time management. While I handle the commercial
floral designs for weddings, I also set aside time for creative work. This helps keep my
designs fresh and inspires new ideas that I can bring into both my artistic and commercial
work. Q What’s next for you in floral art—do you plan to explore more wearable creations
or other artistic ventures? Looking ahead, I plan to continue exploring wearable floralart and expand into other artistic ventures like large-scale installations and flower
preservation techniques. I’m excited to experiment with new materials and collaborate
across different art forms, blending floristry with sculpture, photography, and fashion.
Ultimately, I want to keep evolving as an artist, creating immersive, cross-disciplinary
experiences that bring the beauty of flowers into everyday life in unexpected ways.

page2_article_1.pdf,"Y2K Trend Comeback ft. Denim Skirts
One of the most memorable things about the 90’s was the fashion. The colour, the fabric
and the styles were defini While denim skirts are quite easy to style it can go wrong
equally easily, so here are a few tips. This is one area you are spoiled for choice. With
colours ranging from white to pas If you want a failsafe option pick a simple blue skirt
but if you’re feeling adventurous go for a coloured denim one. The only issue you will
have is finding a top that will match but shopping is half the fun right? Depending on
your event the length matters. If it is for a casual brunch or a meet up with friends a
mini skirt will make a great outfit. If it is for an evening function a midi length skirt
with a slight slit will give you that extra glamour. The best part of a denim skirt is
that almost any top is a great match just make sure it is short. Most often crop tops are
the go to. A casual, simple cut monochrome crop is perfect for any event. If you want to
stand out from the crowd go for a printed top ranging from floral to tribal. Even a shirt
top, especially white, tied up or tucked in depending on how it looks will make for
perfect evening attire. You can even throw on a jacket to stand out from the crowd (and if
the weather isn’t too hot). They either make or break your entire outfit so be careful.
Since a denim skirt is already a fashion statement in itself you don’t want to distract
the focus from that. So less is more in this instance. Adding some gold hoops can elevate
that look from casual to glamour. Shoulder length earrings those of a bright colour will
really complete the outfit. Unless you have short hair it is preferable to wear long
earrings. A chunky chain will also accentuate that mid-length skirt, the longer the better
however a thin 3 tier chain will better suit a mini skirt. If you are more a bracelet and
bangle type of girl and have no other jewelry on make sure they too are of a bright
colour. They don’t have to match perfectly, contrasting colours will work better and draw
just enough attention to your wrists whilst not losing focus of the skirt. If you don’t
want to add jewelry per say a bandanna or scarf can add that extra colour too and really
make that denim skirt pop especially if you’re wearing a monochrome top. It might be
better to keep it to one or two colours as too much of prints can distract your outfit.
Given our tropical backdrop wedges will go perfectly as will gladiator sandals especially
with a mini. Flats will pair better with a mid-length or longer skirt. If you want
something that works for all styles you can’t go wrong with a pair of pumps or stilettoes.

Colombo, a city known for its hustle and bustle is fast becoming known for its fashion
culture. From fashion shows to social events, the people of Colombo are on point with
their fashion game. Gone are the days where it was simply copying a trend. Today it is not
just about the clothes you wear but it is what encompasses your personality, your style
and most importantly showcases your uniqueness to the world. This has paved way for a new
era of fashion designers to unleash their creative skill and hone in on this new aspect in
unforeseen ways and Dulasha Jayawardhana is one such individual. As ‘an artist turned
designer’ she manages to marry both vintage and contemporary fashion and is just about
detail oriented as one can get thus producing one of a kind garments which are long

FMLK. 1. So All my life having had a strong affinity to all things aesthetics all, I
consider myself an artist at heart. This aesthetic perfectionism which I've developed over
the years I apply to all facets of my life, may it be fashion, fitness, food and every
other aspect of my life which I love. Currently, most of my energy is focused on nurturing
and elevating my luxury fashion label, ""DULASHA"". At the age of 26, I find myself exactly
where I want to be, both in my personal life and professional. This puts me in a great
position to discover more facets of myself and apply them to my craft. It's my vision to
manifest an enriching and positive vibe through my brand which motivates my community and
myself to become the most beautiful version of ourselves, inside and out. 2. What made you
fall in love with fashion designing? As mentioned earlier, I have been an artist all my
life. I have won quite a few inter-school, island wide & worldwide prizes as an artist.
But my love for fashion grew further in my late teens, when I was doing my AS Levels at
Ladies’ College Colombo. Later on, my passion evolved after being exposed to the design
culture at AOD. I always wanted to bring art & fashion together, which is why I call
myself an artist turned fashion designer. For me, fashion is a form of art, a way of
expressing myself, which is something I always try to portray in my work. I am also so
blessed and lucky that I have always had my parents by my side. I respect them so much
professionally, especially my father who has been an unconditionally supportive in the
choices that I’ve made, including my label. 3. DULASHA was founded by Isuru Wijesuriya &
myself. The brand focuses its energy in its entirety to offer multi-faceted, high quality,
chic garments with the sole goal to elevate the style of our audience beyond their
expectations. DULASHA endeavours to show, through our craft a version of themselves that
they will fall in love with all over again. We achieve this by creating capsule
collections with timeless pieces which can be combined and styled in many ways to create a
myriad of elegant and unique styles. The underlying goal is to produce garments which are
durable, comfortable, and exciting, which we believe would help satiate the prevalent need
to constantly purchase new clothes. This will be our way of contributing to the global

clothing. 4. What inspired this second collection and how is it different from the first?
Our current collection which we called, ""Dark Twilight"", is an extrapolation of our
previous collection, ""Pas 5. Who or what do you draw your inspiration from? I drawinspiration from art, emotions, history, music, people, food and my own life. My main muse
has always been myself, and every time I get inspired by something or someone, I use that
element to evolve my very own ideas. Every design I create, I’d ask myself, “how does it
resonate with me?"" ""Does it go well with my personality and my body type?"", ""What would
this piece express about me, to the outside world?” among many other questions. I believe
that doing this has helped me form unique designs which tessellate harmoniously with each
other and myself. 6. How do you stay updated with the current trends? I keep myself up-to-
date by following many fashion websites such as, Vogue UK, Harper’s Bazaar and Glamour.
Observing closely, designer brands such as Fendi, Versace, Jacquemus and Christian Dior
among many others, have also helped me keep track of the trends. Among fashion websites
and designers, I also make it a point to pay attention to contemporary style icons and
stylists on social media platforms, such as, Dua Lipa, Kylie Jenner, Lorenzo Posocco,
Xenia Adonts, Danielle Bernstein, Alexandra Pereira and Style Heroine. Vintage style
icons, I believe deserve just as must attention as the contemporary ones. I have taken
notes from celebrities such as Audrey Hepburn, Bianca Jagger, James Dean and Cher, to name
a few. 7. For the aspiring fashion designers out there what would be your top three tips?
Being a fashion designer is such a joy, so my first tip would be to enjoy the journey and
the process. It's just as important, if not more, than the end product. Fashion design, as
fun as it is, is not a walk in the park. It's a multi-faceted discipline and whoever is
excited to join the party should keep in mind to be a perpetual student of the game and to
strive to excel in every aspect of fashion design. Artists have the luxury of being able
to be disorganized and being able to get away with it. In some cases it might even add
value. However, if you want to become a designer, being rigorously organized is of utmost
importance. Let your creativity run wild and keep your work straight and narrow. We wish
her all the best in her future endeavours and look forward to more collections from her!

The then Sri Lanka was home to more than 3000 traditional, heirloom rice varieties and was
renowned as the granary of the East. It comes as no surprise that many people are unaware
of the benefits of rice for skin care. Even though lesser known, rice has been a part of
the ancient beauty rituals that helped women to retain a glowing, youthful skin. Being
rich in nutrients such as antioxidants, vitamins and minerals, traditional rice provided
multiple benefits for ancient Sri Lankans as a staple food while nourishing the skins for
youthful beauty. When it comes to traditional rice, each of the rice types are associated
with interesting tales. The term “Suwandel” comes from the exquisite aroma this particular
rice type possesses. The rice varieties including Suwandel, Madathawalu, Maa Wee,
Hangimuththan, etc are cultivated organically with traditional rain fed methods, adhering
to sacred practices while the cultivation takes a longer time. However, the usage of high
yielding, commercial rice types, has increased over the past few decades. Traditional
heirloom rice types are far more fortified with antioxidants, vitamins and minerals than
improved rice types, which people consume today and are considered beneficial for the
health and wellbeing of people. Diving deeper in to the nutritional benefits of
traditional rice, the brown rice types such as Madathawalu and Kaluheenati are infused
with more antioxidant properties than white rice types. The most potent antioxidant in
traditional rice types, Ferulic acid is known to provide a glowing skin, natural
protection from UV, protect the skin against irritants and pollutants, improve skin
hydration, keep the skin tone even, alleviate dullness and dryness. These rice types also
contain a considerable portion of nutrients rich in vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates and
lipids, which are essential for a healthy lifestyle. Heirloom rice is infused with the
goodness of rice lipids that fortify skin barrier, maintains skin’s acid mantle and
retains essential moisture. The Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) in traditional rice
stimulates cell growth and differentiation, actively protects the skin from aging while
reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. EGF in rice is a protein, which is
similar to Human EGF, which helps to stimulate skin growing cells and faster cell
turnover. In addition, traditional rice acts as a natural UV protectant. All these skin
caring properties together enhance the skin complexion, provide a glowing, youthful and
moisturized skin for women. At a time when today’s health conscious people are moving
towards natural skin care practices, the goodness of rice for skin care is gradually being
talked of, inspired by the ancient beauty rituals and wonders of traditional rice.

To stand out and look amazing is not just a trend but a dream of anyone. From the saree
you wear to the cocktail dress, when you walk into to a room, you want all eyes on you.
This is the dream that Amorine Bridal and Designer Wear is devoted to achieving for each
and every one, with their unique, one-of-a-kind pieces. These custom-made sarees, dresses
and lehengas will not be recreated for another customer. It’s this one-off design that
sets Amorine Designer Wear to stand out as truly unique. Amorine Bridal and Designer Wear
is the pet project of Hasanthi Hapugoda, a self-taught designer, who choose to pursue her
passion of designing her own sarees. Learning the skills and the tradecraft from her
mother, who was also a saree designer back in the day, Hasanthi’s skills were only
available initially for friends and family until she took on the challenge and launched
her own business. Fueled by her love and passion for saree designing, Hasanthi launched
Amorine, in 2017. The word “Amor” is derived from Latin, which means love, highlights the
love Hasanthi puts into designing each custom attire and is the reason she named her
venture as Amorine. With her launch, Hasanthi initially kept the focus on custom designer
sarees. However, thanks to requests from many, already happy customer’s, Hasanthi expanded
her brand to design custom bridal designs; be your style modern, traditional, classic,
romantic or contemporary, she will design it for you. Saree designers and bridal sarees
are now a dime a dozen in Sri Lanka’s ever growing saree market. So, to stand out in this
extremely competitive and glamorous line of trade, Amorine Bridal and Designer Wear uses
their ingenuity and fine attention to details, where each and every saree that you get is
handcrafted and is a one-of-a-kind designer piece that captures “your” dream and no one
else’s. Amorine Bridal and Designer Wear has a wide range of items to pick from. You can
always go with a traditional Indian or Kandyan saree. If this is not to your taste, you
can try and see if a batik saree suits your desire. If you are still not happy, then maybe
a lehenga or a more wester style dress is something that will make you feel alive. But
whatever you choose, the design is still in your hands. If you have a dream outfit, then
Amorine takes the next step and based on what you like she would suggest how she can
improve the design in a way that it will suit you and incorporate all the factors such as
lace work, cut work, bead work and all embellishments to make the saree or dress one of a
kind. Hasanthi and her team pride themselves in the knowledge that they can do hand
painted sarees, custom designed batik sarees or uniquely crafted bead and lace worked
dresses or lehengas. The designs and customized work is always in keeping with the latest
trends and it will also be done to best suit you, so that you will always stand out. Even

and her team helped these brides to achieve their dream of simple elegance with custom
bridal sarees that matched these requirements to a tee. Amorine even provides their
clients with the choice of several shops to buy material from as well so that everything
is in keeping with your taste and budget. Of course, Hasanthi will come with you to help
pick out the right material to ensure that your saree is nothing short of perfect. Because
of the customized nature of each saree or dress, you are going to have to order ahead if

is to message her through “Amorine Bridal and Designer Wear” Facebook page @AmorineColombo
or their Instagram page @designsbyamorine or by giving a call to 0778168109 The usual timeperiod for a bridal saree or dress is around 2 months, but it is recommended that you call
a few additional months prior to make sure you can schedule yourself an appointment with
Hasanthi. For a designer saree or dress the work can take from a week up to a month. This
time includes the process of getting measured up, having the initial white fit-on,
selecting materials and the actual process of designing the saree. Of course, to make sure
that these designs are to your liking, you will get to sit down with Hasanthi and together
design out the saree Now, as each saree or dress is customized and the work and material
required varies vastly, the time to get it done can change around and the rates too will
depend on the design and the amount of embellishment work needed to be done. But all these
can be discussed and worked out with Hasanthi after the initial discussion. So, the next
time you want that movie moment, where you walk into a room and all eyes turn to you,
check out Amorine Bridal and Designer Wear and have then create that picture perfect
designer outfit that will make you stand out no matter the occasion. ""A creative writer,

Modeling is no easy task. It’s an art made to look and feel flawless regardless of the
situation. As onlookers, that’s something we can all agree on. Here’s Amandha talking to
us about his lifestyle and what works best for him. If you are aspiring to reach great
heights in this industry, or just in general, keep reading. This interview might defini
It's generally an early morning wake, a walk into the garden with my dog, a morning
routine (some meditations, affirmations, visualizations and a fun workout) that I consider
my “morning cup of coffee” and therefore, a MUST, and then I jump straight into work which
takes up the rest of the day. Not really. It was more a thing of chance. Like introducing
marshmallows into hot chocolate. Life was relatively alright but after my first gig, life
became this entirely new concoction and I didn’t want life any other way. I was a
relatively late bloomer. I was about 23 when I first got into it and it was every
definition of the word ‘exciting’. It was thrilling, terrifying, a bit nauseating but when
I was up there on the ramp, there was a split second where the lights focused, cameras
pointed and it was just the audience and, at that moment, I felt love. I know I used to be
VERY STIFF on stage, to a point where I was giving the Terminator competition. Before a
show, it wasn’t just butterflies but bees and wasps and helicopters in my stomach, but now
I feel a little more at ease with the whole thing. Now I just have fun with it. This one’s
easy! Every morning: Some form of bean (Mung, Cowpea or Chickpea)/ Red rice, coconut
sambol (like the true patriot I am) and two eggs, followed by a bowl of oats, diced fruit
and a scoop of protein powder. Lunch is a very standard rice and curry with less emphasis
on rice and more on curry and dinner is a small meal with some form of protein and a
cheeky green tea. I space them 2 to 2 and a half away hours from each other and every
Tuesday, I just have more liquids than solid food so porridge, protein shakes and soups.
My workouts since last year have all been body weight exercises and cardio on alternating
days, but I have been experimenting with Pilates, Yoga and Ab and Core Exercises with
Barressential. Long but the most worthwhile journey I've ever made. I was...in a dark
place at one point in my life to keep things light. Blaming it on a bad set of friends is
an easy way of waiving off guilt because the decision to do it was still mine; but it did
get to a point of dependency and that’s where it got scary. In retrospect though, giving
it all up and never looking back was rather easy. I had three Everest like “Why’s” or
reasons not to engage anymore and that just held me throughout. I think I’ve forgotten how
to ask a lady out. That single. (Ladies, help the man out. Take the lead) I love how
progressive Sri Lanka is getting. I’ve had the honor and pleasure of working with some
amazing designers who have taken Sri Lanka’s signature looks, polished and pushed them to
new boundaries, have revamped older styles and reintroduced them and are even introducing
new avant-garde takes, styles and looks into the country and I AM ALL FOR IT! I am a huge
proponent and advocate of “Wear what you want to wear” and hey, the crazier, the better.
There are quite a few, but the one I’m working on currently is learning to be a musician.
This used to really get to me when I first started. I think ‘hate’ began to internalize
after consistently being subjected to random hate as ‘I am a horrible person’ and ‘I have
no value’. All the “Haters Gonna Hate” motivational talk fades away as the light of day
does and it leaves you there, enveloped in darkness and alone, questioning the validity of
your dreams, aspirations and even your existence. But then a friend of mine introduced meto a philosophy called Stoicism which I began to resonate with very passiona I think it’s
the environment you create for yourself at that moment that becomes the make or break
between a hilariously fun shoot and a dreary, “TAKE ME AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!” kind of
shoot. It's also a mix between So, it’s all about the attitude you bring in. It's supposed
to be 7 - 8 hours but that depends on the show or gig. If it's a show that runs for a
couple of days back to back, then you just have to make do. That, and I honestly just love
the work I do, so I'm more or less fine with it. If you want to wear something or dress
differently, do it by all means. It's your body. Life is short. Do what makes you happy.
As a person who has been suffering with body image issues for the last decade, I am all
for accepting different things, really. To say, in an industry that is so prevalent and
influential, that you reject a body type is to reject a person of a particular stature and
that is just not fair. Where I do draw a line to this, however, is where we promote body
positivity with both eyes closed. Being any weight we want is fine as long as we’re being
healthy about it (by a doctor’s or medical professional’s standard) and we’re not using it
as an excuse to waste away. I think content creation is my way of making people smile but
since that also constitutes work, I relax more with music. I watch a great deal of British
Panel Shows because I find them absolu My longest video (practice, performance and re-
takes wise) was about three hours, but hey, it doesn't have to be perfect. As long as

page2_article_14.pdf,"The 'Maskne' Phenomenon
It's now widely accepted that wearing a face mask in public is the right thing to do, for
yourself and everyone else, particularly where social distancing is not possible such as
on public transport and in shops, markets or other crowded environments. Mask-wearing not
only contributes to lowering the risk of virus transmission, but it’s also one of the most
effective ways to slow the spread of the disease and save lives. However, while we've now
become confident about wearing face coverings and understand the necessity, there have
been reports of adverse skin reactions arising from some types of masks usage during the
pandemic. Due to perspiration and insufficient access to air, the production of homemade
masks from various textiles such as cotton, polyester and silk, and the fact that we are
wearing masks daily for a prolonged period of time, dermatologists are reporting that
friction-induced acne, irritating rashes, and pruritus (severe itching of the skin) may
all flare up and intensify underneath a mask. 'Maskne', combining the words Mask + Acne,
describes one such skin condition brought on by the long-term use of protective masks.
Found mainly on areas of the cheeks, chin and around the nose and mouth, maskne occurs
when excessive pressure is applied to the skin in combination with high temperatures. This
phenomenon results in excessive perspiration to cool down the body and triggers the
sebaceous glands to produce more oil. It's no wonder skin becomes inflamed and red as the
pores become clogged. At any rate, we need to alleviate the risk of skin reactions and
minimise the prospect of suffering from maskne. Note that most mask-related irritations
arise from friction and overheating rather than an allergic reaction to fabrics. Choose a
mask that fits correctly and is not too tight, especially behind the ears, to prevent
soreness. Make sure your skin is cleansed and moisturised, and consider using a gel lotion
or light face serum containing bebenzoyl peroxide or adapalene. For people with very oily
skin, a wash that contains salicylic acid is recommended to help remove excess oil and
dead cells from the surface of the skin. Avoid products that boost the production of sebum
(an oily, waxy substance produced by your body’s sebaceous glands) as a mask will trap oil
and sebum and cause your skin to become dry. Wash or boil cloth masks with a mild
detergent before and after use to avoid a build-up of bacteria. Always make sure your face
is fully dry before using. Change masks or face covering frequently. Refrain from or limit
wearing make-up underneath a mask. If you wish to continue using make-up, dermatologists
recommend using products designed for acne-prone skin. Men should shave more frequently to
prevent beard stubble discomfort. Reduce skin irritation by applying talcum powder
underneath the mask. DO NOT keep your mask or face covering loose in your bag, and make
sure you discard disposable face coverings with household waste. Every face is born with a
thousand masks to go with it. Make sure yours is the correct one to prevent the maskne
phenomenon. # maskrelatedirritations -up Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected: All the

page2_article_15.pdf,"The Beauty of Coffee
Despite Sri Lanka being a predominantly tea-loving nation, coffee is increasingly gaining
in popularity these days. A new beverage culture is developing, attracting consumers
towards the multitude of unique blends served at the chic high street coffee chains in the
cities. The country boasts a thriving coffee industry and has done since the 1600s – long
before tea was planted. However, despite the exquisite aroma and rich flavour of freshly
roasted, high-quality coffee beans, coffee has always taken second place to black or green
tea in Sri Lanka, especially after the coffee canker in the 1870s, and so it seems...
coffee is simply ' not everyone's cup of tea'. But wait! Coffee is great for the skin!
Seriously, the sand-like texture of coffee grounds makes a great exfoliant to remove dead
skin cells, helping to rejuvenate and boost circulation. What's more, the caffeine in
coffee grounds has potent antioxidant properties (caffeic acid) that help protect the skin
from sun exposure and reduce the appearance of cellulite. While science Rejuvenating
coffee scrub: Mix together ½ cup fresh ground coffee with ½ cup of brown sugar. Add ½ cup
of coconut oil (almond or macadamia oil can be used) and 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract.
Mix and gently rub all over your body (avoiding the eyes). Leave for 5-10 minutes and
rinse off thoroughly. Energising whitening coffee scrub: Mix 1 tablespoon of ground
coffee, 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar and the juice of 1 lemon to make a thick paste.
Scrub your face gently and rinse off with warm water. Invigorating coffee face mask: Mix
half a cup of coffee grounds with a few teaspoons of milk to form a rich, thick
consistency. Smooth over face and leave for 10- 15 minutes. Rinse off with lukewarm water.
Vitalising coffee feet and leg scrub: Mix ¼ cup of coffee grounds, ½ ripe banana (mashed),
½ cup of olive oil and ½ cup of salt in a bowl. Apply over legs and feet and massage
gently for 15-20 minutes. Rinse with warm water. Nourishing coffee face scrub: Mix 2
tablespoons coffee grounds, 3 tablespoons natural yoghurt or milk, 1 tablespoon of honey
and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder. Spread the mixture onto your face and massage gently
for 10 minutes. Rinse off and moisturise. To enjoy the full benefits of coffee scrubs, you
should apply them to different parts of your body at least 2–3 times per week and finish
with your favourite moisturiser. As with most good scrubs, frequent exfoliating will, over
time, result in a more even skin tone, reducing the appearance of fine lines, scars and
stretch marks. Don't forget: When experimenting with any natural DIY skin treatments, you
should proceed with caution to prevent the risk of irritation and inflammation of your
skin. Coffee, this year's amazing skincare ingredient! Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected:

Fashion is bold! Fashion is fearless! The styles and trends of the fashion market are
dominating the world now more than ever before as it has been taken to new elevations
among shoppers over recent years. Fashion has reflected a Noughties generation that is not
afraid to say, think or wear what they want, jolting up confidence levels drastically!
Vogue has not just become a means of clothing your body, but it has also become the
essence of your personality, beliefs, and attitude towards society and culture. Diving
into the month of Vesak with a taste in unique trends, we at Hi!! Online came across yet
another sprouting career woman who has always had the passion to start her own fashion
brand since she was a little girl! Here is Thirandee Nilakna Premaratne providing a rather
unique take on chic wear to the Sri Lankan Fashion World! After finishing up her secondary
education while residing in Dubai, Nilakna moved back to Sri Lanka with her parents at the
age of 18. At present, she is following up on a degree in Accounting and Finance while
completing her ACCA Qualification on the sidelines. ""I’ve been passionate about fashion
and designing since I was a kid"" she stated. Gifted with parents who are both
inspirational and hardworking, she was wholly encouraged to begin a brand of her own.
Nilakna had always dreamed of becoming a young, thriving entrepreneur all her life and by
pursuing so, she gave birth to her fashion brand “Tee’s Avenue & Co.”. Tee’s Avenue & Co
was born into the fashion industry only five months ago. They stipulate a very likable
service to their customers and are mainly focused on constantly updating and improving the
fashion sense brought up in the 21st century! Being the founder of Tee’s Avenue & Co,
Nilakna told us that she always ensures to design a continuous variety of unique fashion
designs that fit her target audience. Her mission for the company is to provide an
exclusive experience to dynamic fashion lovers as the leading fashion brand while
maintaining its legacy; while her vision is to become a brand that defines global fashion
luxury, respectively. Our talented Fashionista wanted her brand to contain a wide variety
of different & unique styles of clothing compared to a usual fashion store. Her biggest
form of inspiration were the vibrant and prismatic runaway shows that she’d watch on Tee’s
Avenue & Co’s launching line consists of three dresses which are namely the “Red L’amour
off the shoulder dress”, “Smocked layered short dress” and the “Empire waisted short
dress”. I had the absolute privilege of receiving two of their most popular dresses as
complimentary and I genuinely have to mention how comfortable the material is! Their
dresses are very elegant and fascinating, that you can wear them for any kind of occasion
imaginable! Very worth wearing! They are currently designing some new styles for their
upcoming collection which will include a brand new segment enthralled on linen and cotton.
They also have a section of exclusive and casual dresses launching soon. We were quite
interested as to how the name of the brand, “Tee’s Avenue & Co.” had been formed and
Nilakna was able to give us with a crisp & precise explanation. “Tee is the short form of
my first name” she stated. “It’s my most favourite nickname and holds a special place in
my heart. I knew I had to include “Tee” somewhere in the name when I thought of starting
up”. She included “Avenue” because it shows how she’s approaching a destination via her
fashion brand. For Nilakna, the name & logo both create a very strong connection together,
giving it a smooth and homely touch. Although Tee’s Avenue & Co. is only operating in the
local market at present, Nilakna is hoping to reach other countries and be among the topfive premier fashion brands in Sri Lanka in the near future! She is also planning to open
a few outlets around Colombo later on. This incredible, power-grinding, hustler lady has a
few words of wisdom to share; “The most important form of advice is to do what you love.
Always be passionate about what you’re going to start-up and look forward to making it a
success. Always start small and build upwards slowly because then you will have the
necessary ground knowledge about your business which will be useful when delegating tasks
to your employees. I think it’s also important to have a risk-taking mind-set because you
should be able to sacrifice a lot to make your business a success. Lastly, always be
confident and straightforward with your decisions because it will take you to great
places! I am an independent solo artist that debuted last October. I write lyrics, make my
own music and collaborate with fresh and talented producers. I focus on themes such as
Mental Health and psychological aspects of people in order to provide a voice to them and
to let them know that we're all in this together and they are not alone. Copyrights

page2_article_17.pdf,"Dressing From Head to Toe With Modern-day Fascinators
Fascinators are vibrant, wardrobe gems that will undoubtedly make an outfit super-chic
while making a statement. They are very unique and dramatic headpieces attached to a clip
or a comb, typically worn by Europeans. Fascinators are an integral part of British
aristocratic weddings and formal gatherings. These are wardrobe essentials in the European
culture especially when gracing various cocktail parties, garden parties, tea parties and
soirées. The term fascinator originated from the Latin word ‘fascinare’ or ‘fascinatus’,
which means bewitching, enchanting or interesting. These decorative pieces were named as
fascinators in the 1960s and were originally adopted in the late 1970s and 80s in London.
They were initially made of the basics; lace, silk and net and they were comparatively
much smaller in size. Presently, they are worn by royals and also widely used in the
fashion industry as ornamental items. The intension of wearing a fascinator is solely for
the purpose of decoration. But due to the evolution of these eye-catching pieces over the
years, ‘hatinators’ emerged in the early 2010s. Hatinators are an interesting combination
of a hat and a fascinator, which is a piece of headgear that resembles the shape of a hat.
But this provides more protection while covering most part of the head. Hatinators are
said to be most favored by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. Most of the British royals
were rarely spotted without headgear up until the 1950s as the royal protocol states that
the ladies belonging to the royal family should wear hats to all formal occasions. But
some of the contemporary royals are witnessed wearing fascinators only at special, formal
occasions. When picking the best suited fascinators, the attachment that is used to fix it
into the hair, plays a major role. Hair combs, hair clips or bands can be used here and
the fascinator chosen also depends on the hair type and the length as well. There are
different comb fascinators, fascinator clips and fascinator headbands available depending
on the hair type and hair length. These crafty pieces can be styled with a veil and the
glamour of fascinators always depends on the brightness of the color chosen. Pairing up a
fascinator with a dress or an outfit that matches its color will show the true power of a
good fascinator. Matching these with the type and the color of shoes and the clutch bag,
will also be an effective way of formalizing the outfit in a way that it matches the
social event. Dark hair color will suit more light colored fascinators, so that it will
give a contrasting effect. Blond and lighter hair colors will always match fascinators
with warm hues. If a single colored dress is worn, the shoes, jewelry and the clutch bag
can be styled with a separate color. Resultantly this will make these iconic fascinators
stand out. These can be worn on the side of the head and also can be worn on either side
of the head. But it should be placed just above the left or right eyebrow of the wearer.
So this fascinating headgear surely speaks for itself and it also allows the wearer to
freely express the individuality by showcasing different striking styles. Shehara

complementary colour is green, and these two colours can play off one another with
extraordinary effect. Darker shades of red in particular will demonstrate power and
elegance. Check out cherry, pomegranate, strawberry and crimson shades, too. It should
come as no surprise that most shades of blue look great alongside bold colours. For
example, light blue with bright yellow to look refreshing, or with shades of pink to
represent calmness. Meanwhile, royal blue can be matched with scarlet or lemon. These
brilliant colour combinations invariably look chic and sexy, creating the most amazing
styling partnerships. Hot pink, shocking pink, pas There are no limitations to the way you
can use green as an 'ingredient' in exceptional clothing colour combination. Artichoke,
asparagus, avocado, apple and bamboo hues work well with red, yellow, orange, violet and
pink to create fresh contemporary styles. Pairing and harmonising bold colours may seem a
little challenging at first, but don’t be timid! I assure you that experimenting with your
outfits and achieving that fabulous eye-catching, colour-coordinated look will not only
enhance your style but it will also add a pop of colour to your life. Lorraine Cat

page2_article_19.pdf,"Create A Capsule Wardrobe
Shopping is therapeutic. It is a way of starting over or even turning a new page in life.
It is more than just buying, but a sense of satisfaction. More often than not, a guilty
pleasure. However as much we love to shop, fast fashion can have lasting effects on the
planet. Sustainable living is more than just a trendy statement; it’s the ideal way of
life. Sustainable and ethical living should be practiced by us all to preserve and protect
the world for many future generations. When it comes to fashion, many brands are now
taking an eco-friendly turn, including fashion giants such as Chanel and Dior. Creating a
capsule wardrobe is a great method of organizing your closet while not contributing to the
fast fashion movement. After all, less is more! We collaborated with Christeen Silva, the
founder of Absolute to give you a few hacks and tips in understanding what’s ethical and
sustainable clothing and how to create a capsule wardrobe. Christeen defines ‘ethical’ as
upholding integrity whether it's Fashion or otherwise. It’s about being fair to our
surroundings. The living breathing planet and all humans in the supply chain and not only
the brands and the customers. It’s about moving away from the practices which focus only
on what’s the next new design, how cheaply can we make it and how fast can we get it to
our shelves, ignoring the people involved in the process. Ethical Clothing is garments
that were made with care making sure the process of producing clothing is just as
important as selling them. “Every good or bad cycle is bigger than one person or party.
All of us actively or ignorantly participate in it, no matter our role. Brands have a
responsibility to be sustainable in their practices. At the same time, all of us as
consumers are a part of the industry and we have the power to make or break it. By
purchasing something, or more of something we send out the message to brands that we
support their products. Similarly, the day we stop purchasing something, there will no
longer be an industry. Or that industry will be a struggling one. Not just fashion, any
other industry for that matter.” says Christeen. She adds on saying that more we say no to
garments that were made fast, without taking into consideration the impact it had on the
planet or ensuring fair wages to its workforce, they will be forced to produce less or
decide to shift their perspective. Ethical consumerism or being sustainable in your
consumption is a lot more powerful than one might think or stop to realize. Sustainability
is here to stay. With it, sustainable consumerism and conscious consumers. Christeen calls
a capsule wardrobe, a smaller wardrobe that has clothing that compliments one another,
allowing you to create multiple looks, making you feel ready for any occasion, saving you
time as well as money, and most importantly one that you end up wearing. “We have all been
there, and are still somewhat there. How many items do we find in our wardrobes that we
didn’t even know existed? We have way too many items in our closets, which doesn’t still
stop us from saying ‘I have nothing to wear’” says Christeen. A capsule wardrobe is
different from person to person and takes time to build. The most important thing about a
capsule wardrobe is that you know what you own; from every item to every silhouette and
every shade of colour. Christeen: Keep in mind is that you are doing this because you need
a change from all the clutter and to create a wardrobe that works for you. End of the day,
you need to be excited to wear what you own. Fashion is a form of expression. For some of
us, it’s more than functional. So if you don’t build a closet that you are going to be
excited about, why even make it? There are plenty of rules - if you go online, you canread from multiple articles. Even from sustainable brands like ours. You must adapt them
according to your taste, where you live and your budget. Here are a few steps to start
building your capsule wardrobe: Go through items one by one & identity items that you
love. Separate the ones that you no longer like, though you loved them when you purchased
them back then. Often when you purchase something because it was trendy at the time, when
the trend passes by in a matter of weeks or even days, you tend to lose interest. Take a
stock of what you currently have, what works for you, what you want to carry forward, what
you must never buy again. Decluttering is a good first step to start with. Ask yourself
what your style statement is. Try things and figure out the shapes/silhouettes that
compliment your body type. Pick colours that you love, that you know will make you happy
when you wear them. Don’t hesitate to experiment but do it responsibly. Make up your mind
and say bye to any silhouette or colour that doesn’t work for you. Not to Pick those
timeless pieces, the basics that you can wear to create looks that won’t go out of style.
And then a few signature pieces to elevate them. Invest in higher-quality pieces that will
last for a long time and survive at least 30 washes. Fleeting trends are a no-no. Think
about it. Have they served you that well in the past? Divide your wardrobe into sections
according to occasions such as work, gym, vacation, casual and list down your most
essential items such as shirts, blazers, simple dresses, cotton pants, casual t-shirts,
cardigans and slips. Cotton, silks, denim and linens are musts because they are suitable
for our tropical climate. Give yourself and your ideal wardrobe time. Unless it’s a big-
budget movie (despite my above normal love for movies), in real life, things don’t have to
look perfect, to begin with. We thank Christeen for collaborating with Hi!! and sharing
her insights on how to live responsibly and sustainably. Do check out their amazing
collections of basics that would be perfect for your capsule wardrobe. Lihini is a

page2_article_2.pdf,"Walking Tall with Model and YouTuber Sheron Philomen
Sheron, what have you been up to since you started your modelling career at the academy
and what came out of taking part in the Catwalk competitions? Back in 2016, I started
training as a model with Catwalk Model Academy then, in early 2017, I won all the main
awards such as 'Best Model' 'Best Catwalk', and 'Mr Handsome'. I'm the first-ever 'Mr
Catwalk' to come out of the academy. The first contest I entered was 'Face Of Sri Lanka'
in 2017. I won the pageant and from that, I had great opportunities to model in several
fashion shows in Korea while participating in 'Face Of Asia' and the 'Asia Model
Festival'. Since then, I have entered the entertainment business for YouTube content
creation while continuing with my own business ventures as well. So, has the global
pandemic affected the model industry? The pandemic did affect the industry and, like so
many other businesses, everyone lost opportunities to work and pursue their careers. Many
Sri Lankan people have lost their lives to the virus and my prayers will always be with
them and the families they left behind. Thankfully, I think the situation is getting a
little better now. What is it really like to be a model and what are your expectations and
hopes for the future? Suddenly having all eyes on you does feel good but you can easily
feel overwhelmed. Mostly, I've never been afraid to stand out in a crowd so winning the
awards has given me the confidence to further my career in modelling. My plans for the
future are to enter the international model platform and work with the world’s leading
fashion brands whilst bringing pride to my motherland. Currently, I’m represented by
'TalentXAgency' which is helping with my career development and the achievement of my
goals. As a content creator at YouTube, do you consider yourself an influencer? At some
point, we are all influencers in our own way and, yes, I do consider myself an influencer.
I like to give people good vibes and a smile and in fact, I've thought about changing my
approach of content creating to something different, which you'll see on my YouTube
Channel “Sheron Philomen”. Is having an audience part of your social media management and
a good opportunity to be seen by influential people in the fashion world? Yes, as a model
or an artist you should gain an audience with positive vibes and try to personally
interact with your followers. I disapprove of some of the ways individuals crave to become
noticed these days. They are too eager and sometimes unprofessional in the way they manage
their online presence. The goal should be more about achieving popularity with their fans,
and not just fame. Do Sri Lankan model agencies have a standard height range? If so, does
being tall make auditions a challenge? I haven’t come across any height requirements at
castings that I've attended although my 6’ 5” height has always been a positive talking
point. When was your first photoshoot? My first photoshoot was back in my academy days
but, at that time, I still needed a lot more practice with posing naturally etc.
Eventually, I learnt to pose and strut down the runway professionally and became much more
relaxed and confident. What kind of modelling do you prefer? I’m into Runway where you
need to have perfect posture, though I also like commercial modelling too. I’m always open
to other opportunities that could help me reach my goals. What are your hobbies or
interests outside of modelling? I love to travel and explore new cultures, and I’m a major
comics and movie buff. Is it important to you to follow a particular diet or beauty
regime? Yes, as a model, having dedication and discipline with yourself is a must! It’s
self-love and a value that everyone should have. While it’s important to take care of yourbody and appearance, everyone has to figure out what works best for their bodies too.
Describe your personal style. Where do you get your inspiration from? I don’t like to
follow or copy anyone's style. I love being original. I don’t want people to say that you
are the local James Bond or whatnot. I want my own image to shine and be who I am...
Sheron Philomen. Who is your favourite designer and why? I have a few, but probably the
iconic clothing designer Giorgio Armani for his unmistakable collections. What’s the best
piece of advice you have gotten in terms of modelling? Nothing’s given free in life – if
there’s something you want, work hard, be smart, find your strengths and put effort into
what you believe. The best is yet to come... If you weren't modelling, what would you be
doing? Some kind of business which was related to modelling and YouTube... That's all I'm
interested in and what I love doing. Thank you, Sheron.

page2_article_20.pdf,"Your Need-to-know List Before Buying a Designer Bag
For most of us, the thought of owning a branded luxury handbag from one of the world's
biggest fashion houses, such as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada and Hermes, is simply an
ambitious dream. The Hermes Birkin bag, for example, widely viewed as the most desirable
bag on the planet, and considered by some to be a better investment than stocks or gold,
sells from a mere 1.75 million to just over 8 million Sri Lankan rupees. Featuring
palladium or gold hardware, the Birkin is designed with high-quality materials, including
cow, lizard, and luxurious ostrich, as well as various types of crocodile skin.
Extraordinary attention is paid to detail as the bag is sewn, polished and then painted by
hand. As with most luxurious handbag design houses, there can be a long waiting list to
secure one of their new season's range of swanky bags, but ultima Luxury handbags though
come in all shapes and sizes and – luckily – all prices, too. Whether you are looking for
high-end customised bags embellished with crystals, or glamourous yet functional shoulder
bags, totes, clutches or backpacks, you will still need to consider a few things before
splashing out extra rupees on that bag. PURPOSE – It's all too easy to be tempted by the
array of trending handbags on display and fall for innovative clasps, fancy frames and
bags that make a style statement, but you should know before shopping what exactly will be
its purpose. For example, should it be designed to hold all of the necessities for a night
out such as a mobile DURABILITY – No matter how much you are planning to spend, you should
think about the material/fabric, clasps, seams and zippers and how often the bag will be
in use. A bag for everyday use will need to be more robust than one that will only make an
occasional appearance. PRACTICALITY & SECURITY – What will you be putting into this bag?
Take into consideration whether the bag has multiple compartments and whether your
personal belongings will be safe inside. PORTABILITY & SIZE – It's important to decide how
you prefer to carry your bag, i.e. over your shoulder, on the crook of your arm, in your
hand or tucked and hugged under the arm for maximum style and comfort. COLOUR – You should
match your bag with at least 3 items of your wardrobe, and again consider its purpose. If
it is for frequent use, you may wish to avoid buying a light-coloured bag which is more
likely to get marked, thus reducing its longevity. Last but not least, if you're willing
to be a little patient and strategic, explore your options when purchasing a higher-
quality luxury bag. There are many online sites that offer designer bags with huge savings
on their retail prices, and you’ll be faced with a wider selection. At the end of the day,
the important things is to choose a bag that meets your personal tastes. Lorraine Cat

If there’s anything at all to know about me, it’s that I am absolu I am thrilled to
feature an interview with Avinaesh Kandasamy, the Executive Director of Allure Crafted
Silver, a jewellery line that specialises in handcrafted Sterling Silver jewellery, often
embellished with semi-precious stones and cultured pearls. Their pieces, ranging across
earrings, rings, bangles, chains and pendants, have stunning and intricate designs that
are conceptualised by their team of in-house designers, while drawing inspiration from the
Sri Lankan ethnic heritage. To provide some insight about Avinaesh; he had lived in
Australia for the past 7 years, during which he completed his University studies and
worked as an Analyst, giving him a strong grounding to join the family business, Lalitha
Jewellers. Avinaesh is extremely passionate about Allure and harbours strong ambitions for
the up and coming brand. The excerpts are as follows: Our silver jewellery line was
birthed in 2015 by Yasanthi Soysa Kandasamy. Apart from bearing the sometimes-challenging
role of being my mother, she is also the designer and co-director of Lalitha Jewellers, a
family-owned jewellery house which was started by my grandfather nearly 70 years ago.
Allure started as a passion project when designer Sonali Dharmawardena wanted us to create
a silver line of jewellery for her new store at Park Street Mews. Silver jewellery had
always been of interest to my mother as there is more freedom and flexibility that is
afforded to the designer when working with silver, as opposed to the more expensive gold.
My mother is an eager traveller and a designer who is inspired by almost anything. She’s a
creative soul, influenced by her father, who was a barrister by profession but was engaged
in development work and was one of the core founders of the Marga institute. She had the
opportunity to travel with my grandfather at a relatively young age, and the exposure to
different cultures and environments at such a young age perhaps were the seeds of her
creativity. Her jewellery designing career started as a hobby early on and now has been
part of the creative team of Lalitha for over 15 years. The Allure creations are all her
own and conceptualised at all hours of the day! Even though Allure Crafted Silver is a
young brand and relatively new to the market, it has the backing of a near 70-year-old
parent in Lalitha’s. It draws from that experience both in terms of design uniqueness and
crafting skills that have been honed over the years. We have three retail partners who
carry distinct collections. Sonali Dharmawardena, Urban Island and Leather Collection. We
also sell our complete collection on our new website and offer free delivery islandwide.
Personalised notes and gift-wrapping options are available to those who are trying to give
that special someone the perfect present. We are also launching physical and e-gift
vouchers over the next month! We have just launched our new website which features some
exclusive new collections! These will be constantly updated over the course of the year,
based on different events and seasons. We are also looking at unveiling our brand in the
Australian market and are working on some exciting new collaborations with other brands
and influencers both locally and internationally. Our team is driven to achieving our goal
of taking our ethnic heritage inspired designs and crafting skills to the world! There it
is, folks! Make sure to follow Allure Crafted Silver on their journey on Facebook and
Instagram . On a final note - in stating that their jewellery line consists of a whooping
925 piece, it’s safe to say that you can most certainly find your allure with Allure

page2_article_22.pdf,"Saving the World Fashionably with Upcycling
The textile industry is one of the largest polluters of the environment which hurts the
environment in numerous ways, knowingly or unknowingly. Water pollution by releasing toxic
dyes to water ways, high carbon and water footprints are few ways that play a major role
in polluting the environment through fast fashion. Unfair labor practices are another
downside of the garment industry which is on the rise currently. Upcycling of garments is
a magical way of using creativity and imagination to create your favorite fashion styles
out of the discarded. This repurposing of clothes is undoubtedly one of the best ways
forward for a sustainable living. Upcycling is the process where something new, which is
of higher quality, is produced from waste material, whereas recycling is the action of
turning waste into reusable material by destroying its current, original state. Upcycling
of clothing involves being creative with your old clothes while refashioning them into
items of higher quality, in order to bring them back to life. It mainly revolves around
slicing and sewing your old garments to form new fashionable clothing, which provide
better value and quality than the original. This process of upcycling requires fewer
resources than the usual garment production process and it requires minimal energy
consumption compared to recycling. The process can be carried out even at home in a
smaller scale. The process of cutting and stitching of vintage garments together and
forming new pieces of clothing provides an interesting zing to the process. Pre-consumer
waste and post-consumer waste are both used in upcycling. Pre- consumer waste is the waste
that comprises of pieces of clothing that have been left over during the production of
garments, in the textile industry. Post- consumer waste is the waste that has been
discarded after using or any clothing items with defects. Down-cycling is another term
that is associated with upcycling widely. This is also a part of this circular fashion
industry where textile waste is converted into something of a lower value and quality than
its current state. Clothes can be down cycled into rugs, carpets that are less valuable
than they were before. Upcycling is already being done in an industrial scale as well.
Adidas is one of the famous brands that has already stepped into upcycling. Upcycling
promotes craftsmanship of the producers while improving the creativity of the designers.
The local and rural industries that are interwoven with the upcycling process are
contributing to the economic development too. It defini If you ever 1. Turning men’s

page2_article_23.pdf,"1.O.A.K. – Fashion that is One of a Kind
True to its name, 1.O.A.K. (which stands for “One of a Kind”), features its own unique and
fierce style of ladies wear that you won’t find anywhere else in Colombo. The proof is on
the label. The clothing store stands firmly behind a policy that there will only ever be
four items available of any one of their designs, one in each size and colour -- One of a
Kind. The 1.O.A.K. brand is the result of Chrishara Benjamin, a fashion marketer, taking
all that she had learned as a marketing executive to many top international brands such as
Dolce and Gabbana and Saks Fifth Avenue during her time in Dubai, and combining it with
her skill of spotting new fashion trends. The brand, which was brought to life by her and
her all-women team of tailors and pattern makers, creates unique ladies wear that is at
the forefront of high-end fashion in Sri Lanka. Inspired by the need for fashionable
evening wear dress designs, that capture the spirit of strong independent women, 1.O.A.K
has stepped up to fill this gap. In the five years since it opened its first store,
1.O.A.K. has grown to sell not just evening wear but a wide range of women’s clothes from
casual to office wear, yet the brand still prides itself on its eye-catching designs for
an evening-out. Their unique styles, the stylish cuts and especially their colours and
fabrics, are not often found in any other clothes outlet. To help stay as a forerunner in
the fashion industry, Chrishara calls on her experience of working with leading fashion
designers and brands, developing a well-tuned eye to spot shifts and trends that are
likely to take off in the market, to fashion 1.O.A.K.’s unique dresses. Chrishara also
taps into her base of loyal customers, considering their feedback in creating designs that
are both in keeping with the fashion trends while also answering to the needs of her clien
1.O.A.K. has two outlets in Colombo; its first ever store at the end of Alfred Place, and
the other at One Galle Face. The brand is also planning on expanding out of Colombo,
opening its third branch soon in the hill capital of Kandy, to spice up the city’s party
life. Even between their multiple stops, there are no identical dresses, so a tip to
remember is that if you don’t find something that you like in one store, it is likely that
one of their other outlets will have something you will like. A bonus tip if you are
looking for something specific; the One Galle Face store focuses mainly on casual wear and
their dresses also have a simpler elegance to their designs. In contrast, the Alfred Place
store focuses on evening wear dresses with a more bold fashion styles in the dresses.
While 1.O.A.K. is the main fashion line, they also have three other brands associated to
it. The first is called “Pretty Little K”. This is 1.O.A.K.’s brand for girls between ages
10 to 16. The styles here are mainly along the line of casual wear and party outfits for
girls. 1.O.A.K. also has a new specialty, making bridesmaid dresses. These are generally
based on styles that were already available in the store. However, these are made out to
the specific fit of the bridesmaids and in keeping with the wedding’s theme. Building on
this, 1.O.A.K. is planning on launching a new brand soon, called “Brides by 1.O.A.K.”. As
the name suggests this would be custom bridal dresses that are designed by 1.O.A.K.
themselves. While it is yet to begin in full operation, it is certainly something to look
forward to for all the ladies planning their weddings right now. Like almost all fashion
brands, 1.O.A.K. is available online through their website where visitors can check out
the latest styles and purchase straight through the website. However, 1.O.A.K. does
encourage you to visit their store when possible, as this could help you get a morepersonalized experience and you can also have the dress altered free of charge, so that it
perfectly fits your figure. Free alteration is something that is not often available with
many stores but 1.O.A.K. is happy to do this for its customers any time and as often as
necessary, so that your dress is always a perfect fit for you. Ideally, alterations take
three days but under special circumstances you may be able to have the dresses altered
within one day. 1.O.A.K. also showcases their dresses through their Facebook page 1oaksl
and their Instagram page 1oak_sl , so you can try to see what new designs are in their
store before heading over to buy the perfect dress for you. All things considered,

It wasn’t too long ago that art was a ridiculed industry, with society refusing to let
their children choose creativity above sciences. Be it, dance, music, acting or art. Yet,
it has trekked a long way since, and infused its essence into our everyday life. From a
flyer on a billboard and a paperback cover of a fairytale to funky creatives on social
media and video adverts on the Art and creativity seems to perpetually blossom, even in
the face of worldly adversities. During the pandemic, we bore witness to the glory of art,
with more and more artists publishing and promoting their work online. Various artistic
businesses were established and went on to flourish as their products entranced their
customers; to name a few - stunning canvas art, colourful hand-made soap, and artsy
upcycled products. Photography and modeling took over Instagram with youths exploring
their creativity and embracing beauty amidst the lockdown. Now, art is supported, admired
and cherished. That brings us to GOYA Model Management, a model agency that faced the
hardships of the pandemic and came out more poised than ever. In this exclusive interview,
I have the lovely Zuzana Stankova, the Founder and Model Director of GOYA and Aloha Makai,
the Creative Director, to share the story behind GOYA Model Management. I had always
dreamt of founding a Model Agency of my own, following my many years of experience as a
Model and Photographer in Prague and New York. I went on to sign a model’s contract in
2016 with Sri Lanka’s top Modeling Agency. Finally, I linked with my two partners - Aloha
Makai and Sheran De Fonseka, the Chairman. Sheran owns successful hospitality and
nightlife venues that have greatly contributed to elevating life in Colombo - Kama,
Flamingo House, Love Bar and Monkey Business. Meanwhile, Aloha & I come from creative
backgrounds and have always been fascinated by working with designers and capturing
people’s stories. We wanted to create something that enabled us to express our own style.
This led to building something we believe in, GOYA. GOYA represents good story We focus on
encouraging our models and clients to not be afraid of reinventing themselves and going
outside of the norm. GOYA is inherently a collaborative art form; it’s incredible how much
we can achieve together. We work with a curated selection of models who each have an
individual purpose as inspirational role models. Our services focus on making our clients’
brand visible. GOYA helps organizations build positive and lasting relationships with
their customers. Our services include model selection, photography and all-inclusive
production packages, artistic direction, creative content, and strategic brand
consultation. Everything an artist needs to present their work. We approach each project
with a clear aim to achieve the Client’s goal in a relevant and expressive way. Our
passion for what we do as a creative agency is evident across all of our collaborations
and projects. We take on board clients we feel resonate with the GOYA brand. Potential
clients There is no right way to answer this question, but one of the hardest things we
have to do is to reject applicants who truly want to be models. We are very meticulous in
choosing models who can be themselves with us, who feel comfortable in the role and in
front of the camera. We invest in models who have the potential for longevity at our
agency and who benefit from the exposure and the opportunity to be recognized in South
Asia. As a team, we inspire and motivate each other. We share a common goal to support the
next generations of artists & designers. Our way of collaboration has empowered us to do
great work and to deliver creative results to our clients. Together, we have theconfidence to take creative risks, diversify our skillset, and be innovative in this
industry. We have felt the pressure of the unfortunate situation that has affected most
businesses worldwide. It hasn’t stopped us to pursue our vision to make an impact in Sri
Lanka, in raising awareness of designers and artists as a creative agency without
boundaries. Goya is creating a platform that will showcase the endless collaborations
between all art forms and cross-cultural boundaries. Those following us on our social
networks will see our story unfold. Well, there you have it, folks! Be sure to follow GOYA

page2_article_25.pdf,"The Joy Of Dressing Is An Art
You don't need to be 'dressed up to the nines' to look sophisticated or elegant, or have a
wardrobe crammed with Gucci, Chanel, and Yves Saint Laurent. To achieve a classic, high-
end, polished look, you simply need to understand that dressing is an art. Impeccable
dressers discover their fabulous signature styles by mixing and matching thoughtfully-
crafted outfits and by paying attention to their body shapes and what looks good on them.
Not only have they mastered the art of dressing, but they have acquired the skill of
making careful choices, and revel in collecting figure-flattering versatile pieces and
stunning accessories which, when combined, scream grandeur and panache. The art of high-
end dressing also includes recognising what can make all the difference when upgrading
your outfits: Check for defects on garments before purchasing such as different colour,
discoloured or loose threads, dropped or broken stitches, open or unravelling seams,
creasing, mismatching of dye or wrong colour combination (accessories), raw or ropey
edges, faulty zips, unfinished buttonholes and patterns not aligned with respect to the
fabric grain. Replace plastic or metal buttons with exclusive fasteners encrusted with
gems, pearls, crystals or rhinestones to set off a garment and catch attention. Invest in
good, trustworthy shapewear to present a smooth silhouette and highlight your body's
natural shape. By simply paying attention to a few details on clothes before buying them,
and wearing correctly fitting underwear, we can ensure that we have a perfect canvas for
creating our masterpiece! The art of dressing upmarket and comple Combine different
textures and fabrics, such as silk, soft lace, chiffon and organza to add to your
femininity, and stick to mixing neutral colours such as black and navy or cream and forest
green. Washed out, pale and pas TIP Look fabulous, smooth and sophisticated by creating a
simple casual outfit such as a tucked white T-shirt or blouse and a great fitting pair of
sleek denim jeans. Then, add a stylish gold accessory. Stay away from slouchy bags and
backpacks if you want to look cosmopolitan or achieve a corporate sassy image. Instead,
choose a timeless structured bag (top-handle satchel) in neutral colours like black, white
or tan with no fussy details. They look high-class and are guaranteed to transform any
outfit. TIP Choose a chic bag that is the right size and shape for your frame and
lifestyle. Rather than fussy statement shoes embellished with diamante, patterns or
elaborate strapping, invest in a good pair of comfortable leather shoes or sandals that
will adapt to the shape of your foot. Opt for footwear in a neutral colours and avoid
mixing prints! For special occasions, the classic court shoe with mid-heels will take you
from day to night and look fabulous in navy, red, ivory and black! TIP The key to looking
classy and well-groomed requires maintaining a good posture and walking with confidence
and grace. This means opting for footwear that will not cause you to grimace every step
you take. To be ever-so-sophisticated there are all kinds of accessories that can make the
difference to a stunning exquisite appearance: a chic belt, jewellery, a colourful neck
scarf, trendy shades, hair ties, clips and bands. Belts – whether it's classic black or
brown or brightly-coloured, with a simple design and buckle, the simplicity of a smart
belt will add polish to your separates. Match another accessory such as a bag or scarf to
the colour of your belt for a smooth classic look. Jewellery – avoid plastic and costume
jewellery, and instead focus on tasteful classic or vintage pieces such a beautiful watch,
pearl earrings, or gold hoops. Neck Scarves – A silky satin print scarf chosen carefullyto match your wardrobe can be worn in a number of ways to enhance any outfit or even the
simplest jeans and T-shirt attire. Scarves are a great way to add colour and pattern to an
outfit. Sunglasses – Throw on some big, black sunglasses – but find the shape that suits
your face. Hair Ornaments – Bold hair accessories such as pearl barrettes, crystal-
encrusted pins and satin or velvet headbands add a regal touch to an ensemble; but leopard
print can also add a flair. The ultimate finishing touches to your canvas are: healthy-
looking hair, perfectly groomed nails, and naturally glowing skin. For those who love
cosmetics, bold sexy red lips will paint a picture of a strong, independent and determined
woman. Remember, however, the most stylish things a person can wear is a smile! Lorraine

In a fashion forward world, comfort and classy are what we usually look for in terms of
clothing. We don’t just pick outfits off the shelf and hope for the best anymore. We want
the best. Owning something that can be sported at any given occasion is always a plus
point, whether it be at a family brunch, a wedding or even the hottest party in town. And
now you can do so with Esco-Bar’s high quality viscose shirts. Esco-Bar Sri Lanka was
founded by Husband and Wife, Nilukshan and Sandunika in December 2019. A couple of months
later, Nuwan joined hands with the couple and came on board to manage and get the business
growing. There’s a story behind every brand name, and in this case, Nilukshan’s love for
the TV show Narcos came in to play to give the brand a similar vibe. Nilukshan and Nuwan
were just two friends who met through the travel industry and decided to make it work. As
the trust and understanding between them came naturally, they made quite the pair. We all
have friends we’d like to start a business with. Getting up and personal with the friendly
duo, here’s their words of advice in regard to starting a business with a close friend,
“Pick your partner carefully - someone who is committed, who’s willing to take risks and
will complement or round off the skills you bring to the table. ” With all kinds of shirts
available in the apparel industry, the market can get quite competitive. However, Esco-Bar
stands outs as a brand by committing to quality fabric that evoke a feeling of freedom and
comfort. Additionally, they also use biodegradable material in everything produced from
their shirts, to their tags, to their packaging. Their main inspiration behind these
viscose shirts, is our tropical island lifestyle which they try so hard to capture and
deliver through their products. While Esco Bar shirts can only be bought through their
Instagram page (@esco_bar_sl) as of yet, they do plan on expanding and having available
options at physical stores soon. These unisex shirts are priced between LKR 2500 – 3000
and are available in all sizes. Get your hands on these designer shirts and support local
businesses. It’s defini Amra is a full time sustainability auditor who makes time to

While there are no hard and fast rules of fashion, styling your accessories to suit the
occasion is important. A drop earring that matches well with your cocktail dress might not
be your best bet with a glitzy desi outfit. Most women miss out on styling their outfit up
with a pair of earrings, but according to the wise words of Jennifer Lopez, “Women should
never go without earrings. Passing them is an opportunity missed.” So, it’s safe to say
the issue is not if you should wear earrings but what earrings you SHOULD wear. During
most occasions, we toy with a hoop or a stud we find comfort in. But it doesn’t hurt to
jazz up with a few more styles every now and then. Here’s an overview on what earpieces
are options for a stylish outlook. Now that quarantine is done with for the most part,
wedding season has now begun. Those last minute outfits will look absolu Emerita
Collection is an online store and placing an order is just a DM/text away. Anyone can
simply drop in a message through Facebook or Instagram (@emeritacollection) to get to know
any details about whichever item they are interested in. Elizabeth Tailor once said,
“Jewelry has the power to be the one little thing that makes you feel unique” so just as
much, every piece at Emerita Collection has the ability to make one feel unique as it is
handpicked with so much love. Every piece of this collection has its own story. The debate
is if hoop earrings are back in fashion, or if they never went off the trend. What all of
us can agree on though is that hoops are worth owning. They highlight your confidence and
make a daring statement. Pair a hoop up with a red lipstick, and you would seem
untouchable. Hoops can be styled with a business attire and rocked at a business meeting,
keeping the look very classy and not flashy. You can use the same hoops to add a touch of
elegance on a little black dress during a date night dinner. The best place to find a hoop
worth buying is at Cavallé. Customers can purchase through Instagram (@cavallelk) and get
them delivered within 24 hours in Colombo and the suburbs. It will take 2-3 working days
for an outstation delivery. If you’re looking for an alternative to your usual hoop
earrings, CAVALLé is here to cater for the beautiful ladies looking to style their outfits
with modern and versatile designs. All handpicked contemporary designs come with a little
twist, from the tinier hoops to oversized designs that are great for any style and any
occasion. Dangle earrings have been in the fashion industry for quite a while. It’s one of
those pieces that usually go with any casual day to day look and hopefully, would never go
out of style. The length of dangle earrings range and can be worn according to your
preference. Longer dangles probably work best with an off shoulder piece, while shorter
dangles would suit a high neck or buttoned up shirt. They can be rocked with a day outfit
or a night outfit accordingly. KRÀSA has some of the cutest dangling earrings that have a
boho-chic finish to it and can help you spruce up your ensemble with style. Orders can be
placed through Instagram and Facebook (Kràsa.lk). Anyone interested could send a direct
message and delivery would be made within a day or two. Including Island wide delivery. On
request, special gift packaging could be obtained at a nominal cost as well. KRÀSA works

inspiration from Boho – Chic primarily and are a fashion-forward jewelry brand that caters
to a young female audience. In addition to their exceptional customer service they apply
their core belief, “IT’S ABOUT HER, ALWAYS AND IN EVERYTHING WE DO.” Jewelry, whethercustom or costume need to be taken care of in a particular manner. Purchasing jewelry is
never an easy thing so it is of primary importance to ensure that they are cared for. Body
perspiration and moisture are some of the main reasons behind the discoloration of these
fancy pieces. After having interviewed the retailers, here are a few tips and tricks to
make your jewelry last longer and shinier over time. Always secure your pieces in a
jewelry box, Ziploc bag or a velvet pouch and never store too many pieces together. Doing
otherwise, could cause oxidation. DO NOT USE cosmetic products like perfume, hairspray or
body lotion once you wear them. Make it a habit to put these on last and take them off
first. Keep your jewelry dry and clean them with a soft cloth or tissue after use In
conclusion, there is a wide range of earrings out there that could complement your
wardrobe in a fun and elegant way. Support local businesses, peruse their Instagram pages
and expand your jewelry collection because investing in jewelry can never go to waste.

Believe me, a lot of people admire outlandish and unconventional dressers. While outwardly
they may be sighing and tutting at someone’s offbeat sense of style, secretly they are
enviously admiring these fashion rebels who wear what they damn well please, and don’t
feel any need to conform to fashion conventions. There is a compelling fascination in
seeing another person revelling in their personal form of self-expression – after all, you
are what you wear. If truth be told, despite their apparent disdain, these on-lookers are
most likely wishing they had the confidence to step out and array themselves with similar
gusto. And why not? Fashion is more than just an elaborate game of dressing up. It
exemplifies who we are and what we believe and enables us to communicate these values to
others. The act of making a high-profile fashion statement should be personal and fun
while offering a glimpse into our own individuality. Most significantly for the person
wearing the clothes, it's about being able to realise your own vision and values in what
you choose to put on, and shedding the shackles that restrict you. The clothes we wear may
often be dictated by cultural preconceptions, but these may have little to do with who the
wearer is in reality. Whether a man or a woman thinks of their clothes in terms of
‘fashion’, or more in terms of practicality, or indeed rarely thinks about them at all, we
all project an explicit image through how we choose to represent ourselves. From Vivienne
Westwood, with her trademark mix of punk, new romantic and sumptuously elegant ballgowns,
through Lady Gaga's iconic avant-garde fashion moments, to the American reality TV series
“ The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills ” – where the ladies sport lime green sequin-
embellished dresses, hair tinsel, crimson latex, bedazzled barrettes and $25,000
sunglasses – conjuring up alternative knockout outfits is all part of the embodiment of a
fearless and unapologetic self-assurance that’s necessary to stand out from the crowd.
Free-spirited and creative people today are not afraid to push the boundaries and break
outdated society rules, and they don’t worry that they may be labelled ‘fashion victims’.
These fashion pioneers live with the notion that dressing out of the ordinary in eccentric
garb is a good deal cooler than looking like the rest of the population, and they do it
every day of their lives. Why should dressing up be reserved for special occasions only?

Ruwanthi Pavithra Gajadeera is a 25-year-old sustainable fashion designer who in 2021,
with her ‘knli–A Sustainable Collection’, became the first South Asian to win the Taiwan
Fashion Design Award (TFDA). This prestigious international competition takes place
annually, showcasing young enthusiastic fashion designers like Ruwanthi whose creative and
innovative design concepts are exerting a powerful influence on the fashion industry. To
congratulate Ruwanthi and to chat about her commitment to the environment, Hi!! invited
this passionate advocate for ethical fashion to explain the importance of sustainable
design, and to Ruwanthi, well done for your marvellous accomplishment and our best wishes
for 2022! You've had quite a journey into the world of fashion and it's such an honour to
chat with you. Can you Thank you very much for such warm wishes. To be honest it has been
a great 2021 for me. Being part of the international competition really made me grow as a
fashionmonger. I’m truly humbled by how people recognise me as a sustainable designer, and
their words of encouragement have truly illuminated my future. knli's name originated amid
the collection’s development. Looking back and reflecting on the designing process I
realised that it resembled putting pieces of fabrics together, just like fitting pieces
into a puzzle. Hence, I named it knli. knli attempts to combine environmental and social
features to create garments that make an impact while benefiting the wearer by providing a
durable and quality product. At the same time, through responsible designing knli empowers
marginalised artisans and, most importantly, mother earth. Yes, learning heritage crafts
and recreating them was truly a passion of mine. I travelled around the country to meet
and learn from some truly legendary artisans. They helped me to grasp the fundamentals
behind each craft. And because – fortuna I was especially happy that I managed to
incorporate Dumbara panels into the garments. Dumbara mats were this year entered on the
UNESCO ‘Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity’. I think I
was able to enshrine my experiences of travelling in the hill country which is the home of
Dumbara weaving. Some of the Beeralu work and all handloom panels were woven by me, along
with crochet and handknits. For natural dyeing, I used indigenous plants with Ayurvedic
properties. Back in 2017 the Meethotamulla garbage dump disaster, which unfortuna It was
the offcuts created through the manufacturing process. Sri Lanka has an apparel-oriented
economy and makes a considerable amount of foreign earnings thanks to fast fashion.
However, underneath the surface, we can see that a majority of these production plants
produce a lot of offcuts and as a country, we haven’t developed proper mechanisms to deal
effectively with these waste fabrics. Moreover, fast fashion brands rely on polyester,
known to contaminate soil and waterways with microplastic pollution. This is a widespread
issue in the Global South and, if don’t solve this now through better design based on
ethical guidelines, future generations will have to suffer greatly for our failures. I
believe it is transparency. I think the most insightful thing I have learned so far, from
reading academic journals to attendance at webinars, is the importance of transparency. I
appreciate that it’s very tempting to use the word ‘sustainable’, but I also realise that
a big responsibility comes with that. I always rely on reputable research into the methods
I practise, such as zero-waste techniques and other low impact techniques like laser
printing, bleach-free washing and natural dyeing. It's been said that “the most
sustainable garment is the one you already have in your wardrobe” and, if it has becomeworn out, you can always try to upcycle it. I think it's really good to invest in quality
garments without following fast trends and big brand names. As consumers, we have to read
the labels and consider how the garment was produced. Timeless fashion is made with high-
quality sustainable materials with built-in longevity which will allow you to wear it
longer. In addition, take care of your garments while washing them. I moved at a very
young age to a school in Colombo so I've barely spent time with my parents. Fortuna
Looking back at history, we South Asians have always practised the fundamentals of
recycling. Our mothers would mend our clothes so many times before they were considered
old garments. Once something was no longer wearable, we would use it as a carpet or to
make in to rags. Some communities even go further and process old clothing to produce ash
to make cosmetics. However, consumerism has gotten the better of us. We are slowly moving
towards looking at clothes as something disposable. I don’t think it’ll be difficult for
Sri Lankan consumers to handle this shift towards eco-fashion, especially because we are
value seekers and sustainable labels have continuously proven themselves for their value.
I think there should defini However, there are many free resources and certification
programs open for fashion students such as the 'Redress Pathway Course' where students can
learn about sustainable fashion and its latest advancements. In addition, I think the
students themselves have a responsibility to expand the scope of their knowledge and
incorporate this into their graduate work, something which most degree courses encourage
and expect you to do. Yes, it’s wonderful to see the evident enthusiasm among young
designers to incorporate sustainable design practices into their work. I firmly believe
that macro problems can only be solved through collective effort. Where can we find the
best inspiration when looking for sustainable fashion? Step outside: that’s the best place
to look for inspiration. Nature is known to perfect its constructs through the
evolutionary process, and therefore there’s much to learn from nature. Secondarily,
culture and heritage also play a significant role, especially in understanding how my
garments impact on and interact with other stakeholders. For knli, Japan influenced me
immensely, especially because it was the last trip I managed to take before the COVID-19
lockdowns. I was able to draw inspiration from paddy fields to manhole covers, as well as
local design practices. The traditional stitching practice used to produce patchwork
fabric Boro and Shibori inspired me to use waste fabric, giving them new life. And
concepts such as wabi-sabi – which is seeing beauty constantly in the unfinished, and in
imperfection – inspired me to develop my brand aesthetics. Love the clothes in your
wardrobe. I think the best thing you can do is to take care of your clothes, that’s the
smallest, yet the most impactful thing one can do in terms of becoming an eco-friendly
consumer. I love to paint with watercolours, and I also find it very relaxing to watch
videos of people painting. Ever since I remember, I have hugely enjoyed cooking and
baking! I love to be a host to my friends and family, something which I greatly miss
because of the COVID pandemic. Currently, I'm working as a Fashion Designer at Hirdaramani
Discovery Lab, which is a sustainability-focused apparel development centre. We use
environmentally sustainable state-of-the-art technology for denim washing and casual wear
laundry. It's aimed at design innovation, integrating the latest technologies such as
laser printing, laser etching, nanospray washing and ozone bleaching. In 2022, I look
forward to working with our team to play our part in actively solving this puzzle of
sustainable fashion. I am also working on zero-waste pattern making and I think it’s afeasible option to make garments affordable for everyone. Currently, sustainable brands
are becoming too expensive for the average consumer to afford. Although I won’t be able to
match fast fashion prices, I personally believe that sustainable fashion brands should be
financially inclusive as well. Thank you, Ruwanthi. It’s been great speaking with you and
hearing about your sustainable fashion journey. We’ll look forward to seeing your next
collection and talking to you again. Follow Ruwanthie Gajadeera:

They’ve always been that fashion accessory lurking around in the background without
getting their time in the spotlight. Whether as a head accessory or seasonal attire to
keep you warm from the cold they have been around for many years and it looks like they
are here to stay. Initially they were worn by women around the neck or head to protect
modesty or draw attention. Ranging from silk to batik to pashmina or gossamer, they come
in various shapes and sizes. They can be printed, have fringe, be in plaid etc. Whatever
the look they are the perfect way to accentuate your boring outfit and make it look
effortlessly colorful and chic. After all the much sought after Hermes scarf is a true
testament to just how expensive and valued a scarf can be as an accessory. Scarves are
fast becoming a statement piece especially as they are used to commemorate heroes,
movements, political statements and now even the names of fashion designers. As they can
be repeated, giving you a new look each time, they are quite versatile and worth spending
some money on so here are a few tips on how to wear them. Infinity Scarf – it is a
circular scarf and rather new on the scene. They are called throw and go scarves as they
can be looped or just draped over. They come in a variety of materials and colours
including floral, plaid and knitted. Blanket Scarf – they are square in nature and are
meant to be worn in a bigger size. They often come in plaid, checkered or tartan and are
generally found in muted tones. Long Scarf – commonly known as oblong scarves and are
probably the most versatile as they can be worn a number of different ways. Square Scarf –
these are best worn as head scarves, especially bandannas, given their shape. Pashmina
Scarf- they are the crème of the crop as the authentic ones are made from the wool of
Kashmir Pashmina goat found in the Himalayas. Some may include a fringe element too.
Scarves also make a perfect accessory for you hair whether it’s long or short and can be
worn in multiple ways! (Tip – if you have dry hair silk scarves are preferred) The best
method is to hang them on some type of rack like a tie rack. Make sure there are no metal
hooks involved as they can get snagged easily. You can also drape them on wooden or
plastic hangers. If you are really out of space installing a towel bar can be quite
useful. For better storage colour coordinate it so that it’s easier to find in a hurry.

Understanding who you are is a life-long task for almost all of us. Accepting who you are
right now is harder. We are constantly evolving, changing and shedding old skin and our
identity reforms as we do. Personal style is an art of self-expression. It is more than
appearing fashionable or donning the latest trend. Personal style is a display of our
thoughts, values, and everything that has to do with us. Think of it as a mood board
you’ve created for yourself and putting it on where ever you go, so people know who you
are. I, however, am not an expert in the matter but Sumaiya, the face behind the popular
fashion blog Style Decisions is. For her, fashion is a medium of communication. Speaking
fashion with Sumaiya is therapeutic as she deep dives into the art of style and how it has
affected her life. “ Style Decisions is where I connect with the world with my thoughts
revolving around self-expression, mainly with fashion. Nothing ever really interested me
as self-expression. I was not a popular kid who thought she’d end up in this industry. I
wasn’t considered a creative kid even though I always enjoyed watching others creativity.
Eventually, how I identified myself was a lot clearer and had a happier mood with fashion
in the background so I dived in the way I can. It was almost like manifesting in the
beginning and now it’s combined with hard work, staying updated and communicating to
others about it and creating a community around it.” Says Sumaiya about the inception of
her blog. Finding out our personal style may seem a tad bit superficial for those of us
who are not as invested. I have thought ‘who cares?’ a countless number of times as I
carelessly throw on whatever I find first as I rush to work; a stylist’s nightmare.
Sumaiya offers great insight on why finding out your personal style is more than just
looking good. “We can all feel a bit lost at times so having a personal style reminds you
who you are even when you can’t remember. It keeps you grounded even during a wave of
trends that don’t have your name written on them. Also, it affects how you carry yourself
in other parts of your life too, not just with how you dress. Try doing something with
something you hate on versus the outfit you like the most, you will feel a different level
of confidence.” Style Decisions recommends four tips on curating your personal style:
1.Shop thrift “Thrifting helps! You just need to ask the right questions from the seller.”
Check out: @thrift.sl, @thriftedlk, @thrift.n.thrive, @thriftsrilanka, @thrift_with_maya
on Instagram 2.Identity is everything. “Your clothes don’t have to be bold and loud; it
can be basic and minimal; emphasis is on identity.” 3.Invest wisely “Always have a good
balance of statement pieces and basics” 4.Follow the right people “Know your role models.
Hint: They don’t’ have to be famous” Changing your style to something that you feel more
like yourself can be intimidating. The good news is, you’re never alone; it is a normal
part of discovering who you are. “Yes, everyone including I hated the way I dressed. Also,
my family background wasn’t very supportive so I didn’t have a lot of freedom until I
moved out. However, I didn’t wait till that time came to start. I started small by making
little additions, watching how people like Alexa Chung or Kate Moss wore, constantly
educating myself and now fashion is a big part of my life. Everyone has a way of doing it,
you just got to start somewhere with authenticity as nothing can beat that.” Visit Style

Sri Lankan women are brand savvy when it comes to cosmetic labels, trends and pricing.
With high-end beauty products nowadays available locally, online, or from overseas (often
at considerable discounts), they can have the same luxury purchasing experience as women
anywhere else in the world. Yes, the leading luxury cosmetic brands may cost a pretty
penny, but with the shift towards ethical marketing, alongside creatively eco-friendly
production methods, women around the globe are now becoming too glam to give a damn !
Luxury cosmetic brands are spending millions on research, development, and clinical
testing, working tirelessly to investigate every ingredient and combination. Employing a
higher proportion of natural plant-derived extracts and superior raw materials, there is a
stark difference in quality and effectiveness between these brands and those that rely
more heavily on cheaper artificial alternatives, and are priced more modestly. Luxury
cosmetics will invariably be safer, achieve better results, and be more gentle on the skin
because of the quality and distinctiveness of their ingredients. In addition, exclusive
cosmetics usually have a wider range of colours to choose from, which makes them versatile
and suitable for almost all skin types and tones. So, from mascara to nail polish, lip
gloss to eyeshadow, if you want to know whether your cosmetics are luxury-quality or
simply over-priced, check out the key ingredients and think about the research and labour
that has gone into each product’s development. Less expensive brands will often seek to
cash in on a luxury brand’s research by copying their formulas while substituting some of
the more costly ingredients with cheaper alternatives. These inferior copycat cosmetics
are produced in very high volumes, sold in bulk, and most certainly have less longevity.
Simply comparing and researching their constituent ingredients, however, isn't always
going to explain why some cosmetic brands seem a little more on the expensive side. A
number of factors may increase the price you are paying for the product; for instance, if
it is a top brand name, or if it boasts better application devices (such as eyeshadow
brushes, foundation sponges, or mascara and powder applicators), or perhaps it comes with
pretty packaging, contains more moisturizing ingredients or add-ins such as serums, light-
reflectors and sunscreen, has a luxe fragrance added to the formula, or increased
pigmentation (a good lipstick relies on excellent pigmentation) – at the end of the day,
you will have to decide whether these additional extravagances justify the extra cost.
Finally, you should wake up and makeup only after checking that all your luxury brand
cosmetics have been: There is great pleasure to be found in buying the best luxury
cosmetic brands with their beautiful packaging, and seeing the difference they make to
your appearance. Regular use of high-quality cosmetics will in the long run nurture your
skin and help you look and feel your best. What's more, with a well-made set of makeup
brushes ... every woman can become her own artist and work of art, creating a perfect
flawless visage! Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected: All the content on this website is

page2_article_8.pdf,"FOR OUR EYES ONLY - LUXURY LINGERIE
A woman's lingerie can say a lot about her persona. While some of us are happy to stay
focused on comfort and functionality, giving priority to practicality over appearance,
there are others who choose hot, sexy collections in silk, chiffon, satin and lace. The
truth of the matter is that high-quality luxury fabrics feel sensual and velvety on the
skin, and super-fancy garments (such as push-up bras, thongs, corsets, silky camisoles,
garter belts, hosiery, and lace-trimmed teddies) can be both elegant and playful.
Splurging on beautiful, sultry lingerie can be an act of empowerment, an extravagant
indulgence, and one of those little things one does for oneself – a secret pleasure. In
fact, women who enjoy wearing beautiful and exotic lingerie are usually extremely
comfortable with their sensuality and femininity. They appreciate that dressing erotically
is not always about flaunting their sexiness, and nor is it for their partner's benefit
only. Of course, there is no question that wearing intimate underwear for someone special
will generate a little magic, firing up their imagination and creating a flirtatious mood,
but in my view there is nothing more sensual than a woman willing to dress for herself,
not to impress, but to feel the sexual liberation, power and the glamour of her sensual
lingerie under her clothes. She is daring and entirely comfortable in her second skin –
celebrating her body and the freedom to express her inner desires and personal identity.
There's another simple reason for wearing pretty luxury lingerie, too – the quest for
ultimate perfection. Undergarments that are seemingly invisible beneath clothes are often
worn to improve what are commonly regarded as flaws in the female figure, and every woman
– regardless of her size and body shape – should be seeking out lingerie that fits her
well and which will enhance the appearance of her outfit. Seamless panties and push up
bras are a good example of this, acting not only on our body shape directly, but also
indirectly as they improve how we perceive ourselves. Feeling good about how we look
results in better posture, and improved confidence has a positive effect on how we carry
ourselves physically. Switching to more luxurious lingerie can also contribute to your
concern for the planet, as increasingly producers are offering environmentally-sound
fabrics and manufacturing techniques, which you may be less likely to find in cheaper,
more functional underwear. If you're now feeling inspired to update your lingerie
collection with the addition of a few intimate garments, items that are a little more
fancy than your basics, it's important to know your body measurements to determine the
right fit. To do this, you can visit an underwear store for sizing or use one of the many
online facilities such as https://everydaylingerieco.com/pages/sizing . The simple rules
are: measure yourself in your undergarments; stand up straight when measuring; and ensure
the tape measure is level all the way around your body. Don’t be shy – enjoy fabulous
luxury lingerie, even when it's for your eyes only, and start a love affair with yourself.

It's awe-inspiring to witness the wonders of make-up! We attempt to observe, make sense of
what these artists have created and how they have done it in order to comprehend the
ideologies and concepts they have depicted through their looks. Being a very small island,
it was very surprising to come across our own talented individuals who have taken the bold
step of creating a world full of color. Through their brushes and puffs they’ve been able
to channel their inner creativity and fearlessly bring their personalities forward to the
outer world! Anisha Kamalgoda is one such story from Colombo's most sensational, color-
crazed young make-up artists who has strived to make a difference using the art of make-
up! A 19 year old Anime fan who studied BTEC Hospitality at Ladies’ College, Anisha has
been running her make-up page for the past two years! She’s mostly up in her room either
painting or experimenting with vivid make-up looks which she shares with her Instagram or
TikTok fans via socials later on. 1. We've seen some really amazing make-up looks from you
via your Instagram page @blendsbya; what or who inspired you to go for such looks? How did
you learn to master it so well? My looks are mostly influenced by the work of other makeup
artists. My looks are mostly influenced by the work of other makeup artists. I first heard
of James Charles when I was about 15 years old, just before he released his Palette. The
looks he created and the way he used vibrant colors in his looks inspired me, leading me
to discover other makeup artists such as Abby Roberts, Payton, Rowi Singh, and so on. I
also noticed that only a few Sri Lankans attempted ‘crazy' looks. Even though I was
scared, with the support of my friends, I just went for it and created ‘blendsbya’. I
wouldn’t say I’ve mastered the art of makeup. I just practiced a lot while watching a lot
of videos before I started my page; Learning from every blend. My first few looks were not
so great, and they were only seen by my friends, but after a while I just got the hang of
it. I kind of relate creating looks to painting on a canvas. When creating looks, I
learned not to show any harsh edges- smooth blending and good color transitions can make
anything look good. 2.How do you decide what look to go for and what makeup you're going
to use for that particular look? It's funny because I actually don’t prepare makeup looks
like that. If I see something that inspires me or appears to be a little difficult, I
usually do it that day itself. I love experimenting with color and trying anything that
looks creative. Halloween looks are my favorite, that's probably the only time I prepare
what I want to do ahead of time. Deciding what to use for a look, at least for me, isn't
so difficult. I use whatever I have and the James Charles Palette has almost every color
necessary to create the looks I want. Other than the basic makeup base, I also use some
face paints and gemstones, but that's about it - nothing too crazy. I truly believe that
you must work with what you have, and how you decide to use it is what will grab people's
attention. 3. What are your favourite make-up brands and why? I don’t have a favorite
brand because I rarely stray away from my usual makeup supplies. But if I had to pick
something, it would be the James Charles X Morphe Palette. The colors in the palette
create endless possibilities. 4. What are your everyday makeup products? If I'm going out,
I always wear eyeliner, lipstick (Huda Beauty Matte Lipstick in the shade Pool Party) and
highlighter. Foundation isn’t my favorite thing to wear since I break out very easily. 5.
How has the ongoing pandemic affected your work? The pandemic hasn’t really negatively
affected my makeup page. I think a lot of my motivation got drained out at one point andbeing at home added to that, so I took a break from posting. But with the ongoing lockdown
I’ve been able to do some looks and will continue to do so, especially with Halloween
coming up soon. Because of the current situation, I have more time to work on makeup
looks, so it's been both good and bad. 6. Any past collaborations/projects you've done?
I’ve actually done a few collaborations. I don’t usually take anything on unless I feel I
can work creatively. I did two looks with Yashvin Senanayake (@itsyashvin) featuring
Thanisha ; a ‘mother nature’ collaboration with Minalee Madanayake (@minaleemad) and Alina
(@ecoconscious.warrior) , a christmas glam look with Satyn Magazine and a project with Spa
Ceylon where I curated three halloween looks using their products. 7. What should Anisha's
fans' expectations be for the future? I can't say I have ""fans,"" but rather ""supporters.""
I am grateful to everyone who follows me and is always there for me.I rarely receive any
hate. Expect some crazy and colorful looks, I would say. 8. Any social media platforms you
use to promote your work? As of now I only use Instagram and TikTok for makeup
(@blendsbya) . Additionally, I run a separate Instagram page where I post art content
(@anisha_142) . Except for the difference in supplies, creating makeup and art are pretty
much the same for me. 9. Any advice for budding and upcoming make-up artists? I always
advise people to try to be consistent, posting on a regular basis if possible. It's
perfectly okay to take a break if you need one! Staying consistent won't be a problem as
long as you enjoy the creative process. You don't need a large makeup collection to start
a page; just use what you have. Don’t be afraid of what others will say, just do it
anyway! Everyone will always have something to say, which can be intimidating, but don't
let that stop you from doing what you love. Continue to try, be yourself, and take your
time to get comfortable posting online. Have fun and practice whenever you can. I am an
independent solo artist that debuted last October. I write lyrics, make my own music and
collaborate with fresh and talented producers. I focus on themes such as Mental Health and
psychological aspects of people in order to provide a voice to them and to let them know
that we're all in this together and they are not alone. Copyrights protected: All the

If you’re a skincare junkie, you know there is nothing more satisfying than finding the
right set of products for you. Being a sucker for all things skin, I do my share of in-
depth research in finding the perfect match for me (and my bank account) but I’m often
skeptical about how well the international brands would work with the island weather and
local skin types. With COVID-19 changing the game of the local economy, it is very
important that we support our homegrown businesses. When it comes to skincare, local works
best for most of us. So, nourish yourself with Sri Lankan skin and hair recipes that have
passed down from generations of skincare addicts! Here’s a list of skin and hair care
brands you can use to curate your own Sri Lankan skincare routine! Started off with simple
sugar scrubs, they now produce an array of skincare products from powdered masks,
cleansers, face mists and different types of scrubs (face and body). They often use
organic honey, coconut oil, turmeric, moringa, coffee and other goodness in their
products. Coast swears by keeping their products 100% clean with no harmful chemicals
included in their list of ingredients which makes them safe to use on skin types. With
their ultra-chic packaging and proven to be effective products, what’s not to love about
this brand? Bestsellers: Just Honey Cleaner and Radiate Face Mask Their products range
between Rs. 600 and Rs. 900 Available online, The Design Collective Store and Urban Island
Colombo. https://www.instagram.com/coastbotanics/ Apart from the funky brand name, Gooey
is a skincare brand that has impressed many. Started off as a passion project, they now
have a portfolio of skincare essentials that only uses certified organic cold-pressed oils
that preserves the highest potency. Gooey believes that skincare should be simple and skin
deep. Currently, they have an eye-lash and eyebrow serum that consists argan oil, sweet
almond oil, castor oil and vitamin oils that helps boost collagen production to give life
to your lashes and brows. The restorative prickly pear facial oil is rich in vitamins and
amino acids, and of course, prickly pear oil that would help you with dark under eyes and
reducing the signs of ageing. Visit their Instagram profile to get an in-depth and
scientific rationale for their products and how they would work for your skin. Their range
consists of the two products at the moment but they are working on coming up with more
formulas for other skin conditions and we can’t wait! Their products range between Rs.

page3_article_13.pdf,"Essential Makeup Brushes and How to Use them
Every woman who uses cosmetics regularly should invest in a good set of quality makeup
brushes. Not only do they enable you to apply makeup quickly and easily, but they also
help products go on smoothly and evenly, creating a more flawless finish. Ideally, they
should be made from high-quality synthetic materials instead of animal hair and not tested
on animals. A high-quality foundation brush with straight flexible bristles will ensure a
smooth application of makeup onto your skin and over pores, crevices and lines. Start by
dotting the powder foundation onto your forehead, cheeks, nose, and chin, and then use the
brush to blend it in evenly over your entire face. (For liquid makeup, opt for a sponge
instead of a brush). TIP: To prevent harsh makeup lines around the edges of your jawline
and hairline, slightly dampen the foundation brush with warm water. A kabuki brush is
usually used to apply loose powder on the body and face. Due to its size and design, the
brush blends your powder foundation or shimmer smoothly on your skin and creates a very
natural-looking coverage. You can also swirl this brush to blend, buff, or stipple liquid
or cream foundations for a far more natural and sheer coverage than what can be achieved
with a regular foundation brush. TIP: Dip your kabuki brush into the powder and spread
evenly across your face, being careful not to press too hard so as to avoid spoiling your
blush and highlighter, etc. A concealer brush covers imperfections, acne and dark circles
under the eyes, and it's ideal for targeting small specific areas that you want to be
concealed. When using a concealer brush, apply a small amount of product to the desired
area, and then lightly dab onto your skin until it blends in with your foundation.
Concealer brushes are also great for sharpening and cleaning up messy eye makeup or
lipstick bleeding. TIP: For a more realistic even finish, dab the tip of the brush into a
tiny amount of concealer and gently pat the brush onto the skin to conceal the area. After
applying your base, you may want to set it or touch it up later with a layer of loose
powder to help your makeup stay in place throughout the day. Powder brushes are usually
very large and fluffy with a domed shape to disperse the powder lightly over the face. You
could get away with applying brush or bronzer with this type of brush. TIP: Tap off the
excess powder on the brush before applying it and swirl in circles or sweeping strokes
over your face. Fan brushes are great because of their multi-use functionality, for
example, applying highlighter, bronzer or as a mistake-corrector. They have very thin
bristles that can even be used as an applicator for sunscreen, lotions and other skincare
products too. TIP: When you've applied too much eyeshadow and flecks of pigment are
everywhere on your face, you can use a fan brush to gently brush away these extra flecks
of colour. A blush brush is similar to a powder brush but smaller, to brush the cheeks.
Some have a slight angle to them for a more precise application as this allows the brush
to pick up the powder and dust it more softly without leaving harsh lines. TIP: Always
start your application of the blusher with a small amount on the apples of the cheek and
then sweep the brush out blending towards your temples. Contouring is a great way to give
your face a naturally sculpted look, but you need a good brush to do it. A contour brush
is about the size of a blush brush, but it has very dense, angled bristles that will
create a precise contour application allowing you to follow the natural curves of your
face. This brush can be used with either powder or cream contour products. TIP: To apply
the contour and to emphasise the hollows of your cheeks, use a dark colour which is acontrast to the 'highlight'. Then gently glide the brush back and forth towards your
temples, along your hairline, the sides of your nose and under your jawline for a sharp
sleek look. This kind of brush is used to apply eyeshadow smoothly to the top of your lids
whether it be in the form of cream or powder. TIP: For the best results, mist your brush
with a setting spray to deepen the opacity of a powder eyeshadow. This brush is used for
applying eyeshadow to the crease of your eyelids. Start by putting a small amount in the
creases of your eyelids, focusing more towards the outside of the eye. TIP: Run the colour
back and forth to create a defined line, and then slowly start to blend the colour in with
your lid colour. An eyebrow brush or a spoolie brush has flat, blunt and angled bristles
for shaping, defining and grooming your eyebrows. It can also be used for de-clamping your
lashes. TIP: Use an eyebrow brush to fill in sparse brows with eyebrow powder, then comb
through your brows to soften them if you’ve filled them in with too much product. Out of
all the different types of makeup brushes, one of the most essential is a good sharp liner
brush to achieve an ultra-precise cat-eye shape. Although you can achieve a good smokey
eye with a pencil liner, it's hard to get a clear, defined wing shape without using a
brush. An eyeliner brush that is slightly angled works well with gel or liquid liners.
TIP: The wing should follow the curve of your eye instead of sticking straight out, and
you may also want to apply liner to your bottom lashes using the brush if you are creating
a very intense eye look. Lip brushes can make applying your lipstick much easier by
helping you get a crisp, defined line. They are very small and thin, with a layer of sleek
bristles that act like a paintbrush. This brush can also be used to blend two lip colours.
TIP : Start by applying a lip liner in a colour similar to your lipstick to get a clean
line and use the brush to paint in your lips. To wash your brushes, use a gentle cleanser
or baby shampoo to rinse out the makeup from the bristles. Work the cleanser into the
bristles with your fingers and then swirl the brushes one at a time in a bowl or on the
back of your hand to remove the makeup. Rinse and repeat as many times as needed and lay
them out to dry on a paper towel and use your fingers to reshape them. Wash them regularly
to prevent bacteria from forming. Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected: All the content on

page3_article_14.pdf,"6 Wardrobe Revolutions To Make In 2019
As we have approached the later part of the year of 2019 most stylish yet – here are a few
tricks and tips to revamp your closet. From holding onto not so new clothes that never get
worn to- panic buying pieces that won't have more than one outing, we are all guilty of
making less than sensible decisions when it comes to our wardrobes. But, it doesn't have
to be that way. We’re all ashamed be it a party, a wedding, a Friday night reunion with
cherished friends or just heading someplace exciting means we inevitably feel like we need
something special – and thus something new to dress up. However, more often than not, as
much as we like the piece that we lay eyes on which ends up in your closet, it seldom gets
more than one outing. Instead of purchasing something definite for certain events, try to
have a few classier pieces in your wardrobe that are definitively more versatile. Try
simple and more classic designs, rather than ‘just’ trending pieces, you’ll be able to mix
and match to suit the occasion accordingly with the veracious accessories it could never
go wrong 2. It’s not surprising to hold on to pieces that no longer fit you in the
optimism that they will fit again one day. It’s also not uncommon to purchase something in
a size too small as an incentive to lose weight or because it’s in the sale and they don’t
have your standard size. However, holding on to these items – that you can’t physically
wear – is one of the vilest things you can do if you’re trying to reduce the space of your
closet. Be realistic and honest with yourself. If it doesn’t fit you, donate it to
charity. As much as holding onto outfits that doesn’t fit, many of us keep pieces that we
know don’t suit us. Often we’ve purchased something on a whim because it’s a huge trend or
because we saw someone else rocking it and thought they looked wonderful - nevertheless
because it just doesn't suit us, we've never actually taken it out of the closet. Key
note: if a piece of clothing doesn’t make you feel confident and comfortable, it factually
has no place in your life. It’s convincing to be won over by a giant discount, and you
should make the most of huge markdowns – especially when it comes to investment designer
pieces – however only if that piece is something that you actually need to add to your
collection. Never buy something just because it’s a great deal. No matter how inexpensive
it was, if you would never wear it, it’s an ample waste of money. A brilliant way to keep
your wardrobe at a sensible size is to adopt the one-in, one-out rule: every time you add
something new, take a piece out (sell it or donate it to charity). Not only will it keep
your shelves from overflowing, it also means you have to be much more assured about what
you are purchasing. You’ll never buy an outfit unless you entirely adore it, knowing that
you are going to have to lose something significant from your wardrobe. Using the
aforementioned question “does this outfit spark joy?” as Marie Kondo’s guiding principle;
I’ve significantly reduced the size of my wardrobe. It’s difficult to get rid of clothing
that you like, but the sense of coherence and harmony that a well-structured wardrobe
brings is priceless. Read her book Spark Joy: An Illustrated Master Class on the Art of
Organizing and Tidying Up (The Life Changing Magic of Tidying Up) or watch the new Often
we get fixated in style ruts, feel like we dislike every piece in our wardrobes and
constantly feel like there is have nothing to wear. When this occurs, more often than not,
we go on a vast shopping spree and end up spending big amounts of money on precisely these
trend-led designs that end up sitting in our wardrobes eternally, never being worn. Do Not
let it get to this obnoxious point. Instead, keep an eye out all-year round for piecesthat you love and mark a note of the key design pieces that you are missing when you
realize it. Think of it as a constant and evolving process, rather than going back to
square one every few months. Allowing you to invest on one trendy piece every month,
rather than having two huge shopping sprees a year will likely result in much better
thought-out decisions and, as a result, a far more stylish wardrobe. Copyrights protected:

included plenty of muted tones, like taupe and camel, all throughout his designs and even

pops of solid colors were added, including fiery red, but the Spring 2019 designs remained
cohesive and monochromatic — and yet, they were anything but monotonous. Fall 2019 Ready-

side of caution by going with black and white, escaped the worst of the online commentary.
No wonder this killer combo has become so popular again this year Charlize Theron wearing
Dior, Golden Globes 2019. Trends may make fools of us mere mortals but monochrome rarely
leads to regrets. By definition, monochrome may mean varying shades of the one colour, but
we’ve come to recognize it as black and white. Navy and white works too if you find black
too draining on the complexion, as spotted on an elegant street styler Darja Barannik at
Copenhagen Fashion Week. Karl Lagerfeld held true to his predecessor’s aesthetic with that
signature Chanel look providing the foundation of every show and the default choice of hismuse Keira Knightley whose understated glamour has won her those big bucks contracts. The
best part about black and white is that it’s just so easy to put together as long as you
resist that urge to add colour, then it can head off in a different direction entirely,
one we can’t insure against. For those who like pattern, there’s plenty of zebra print,
checks and stripes on the high street to play with if you fancy more of a challenge. With
fast fashion under ever more scrutiny in these changing times, those black and white buys
are sure to last the test of time. Maybe that’s one of the reasons it’s become the non-
colour combo of the season. Copyrights protected: All the content on this website is

page3_article_16.pdf,"’Ethical Fashion’ with KANTALA’s Sustainable Vegan Handbags
As part of our new series on fashion labels with an eco-heart we take a look at the
Kantala brand, named after the Sanskrit word for the Hana plant and founded by Nadishan
Shanthikumar & Vikum Rajapakse in 2013. Kantala offers a selection of Eco-friendly
handbags with a touch of contemporary flair that are good for your wardrobe and your
conscience. Most importantly, Nadishan & Vikum are very aware of the impact that the
fashion industry has on nature and they have been striving to counter those ill-effects by
supporting local highly-skilled artisans and preserving their traditional craftsmanship.
All their merchandise carries PETA's vegan & cruelty-free certification, meaning no
animals are exploited during the manufacturing process. From handcrafted clutch bags,
passport holders and wallets to crossbody bags, totes and travel accessories, all
Kantala's products are made from natural materials: Both in their thirties, Nadishan from
Colombo and Vikum from Kiribathgoda, the two men came up with the idea of an eco-friendly
brand whilst working together at one of Sri Lanka's largest apparel manufacturers. They
noticed a growing demand for ethically made products and felt that Sri Lanka should become
more than just a manufacturing destination for global fashion brands. With this goal in
mind, they launched their venture in the little village of Henavala in the Dumbara valley
of Kandy district. Both men agree that their mission at Kantala is to “deliver artisan
fashion accessories that bring empowerment and cheer to the world of fashion, where
consumers have the opportunity to invest in responsible high-quality handbags, and
traditional artisans can build a sustainable and respectable livelihood”. They also say
that their biggest challenge in getting consumers to seek out more ethical and sustainable
alternatives to high street fashion has been “convincing them to pay a slight premium for
a high quality product that has been ethically made with our planet and people in mind”.
They add, “Consumers have gotten used to a fast fashion lifestyle where prices are low” .
At Kantala, they are proud to claim: For over 300 years, the inhabitants of Henavala
village, near Kandy, have perfected and passed down the art of handwoven Hana mats to the
next generation. When Nadishan and Vikum first met the artisans of Henavala in 2013, the
craft was hanging by a thread. Kantala is a success thanks to the hard work, training and
support of chief artisan, Mr Dharmadasa, and those craftspeople residing in the village
who carry on the tradition with pride, passion and precision, using the same techniques
and tools as their ancestors. Kantala's handbags and accessories are available in
different styles, sizes and colours so there is certainly something for everyone. I
ordered myself a stylish pink 'Aayuh' clutch bag from their online site. However, you can
also buy your own from retailers: 'Barefoot','The Design Collective', 'Fashion Market. LK'
and 'Rithihi', all located in Colombo. Nadishan and Vikum For more information on Kantala:

page3_article_17.pdf,"Stay Beautiful and as Cool as a Cucumber During the Heat!
Trying to maintain a fresh flawless look in a tropical climate can be exasperating when
temperatures soar and the air is hot and humid. However, adapting your beauty routine
according to the weather can be easy and less frustrating with these valuable practical
tips! Whether indoors or outside, the number one rule for having squeaky clean skin is to
stay hydrated. A stifling hot atmosphere will quickly remove moisture from your body so
you really do need to replenish both water and essential salts. Drinking plenty of
refreshing coconut water which is more hydrating than plain water and fruit juices, and is
a natural source of vitamins and minerals, is vital. You should also avoid clogging up
pores with lots of moisturisers, thick creams and makeup if your skin is particularly dry
during the hot season. EXPERT TIP: To cool down, close up large pores and to prevent your
makeup from melting, gently massage an ice cube over your entire face for a couple of
seconds before patting dry your skin. You should wear less liquid foundation when it's
sweltering hot and avoid thick formulas too so as not to clog pores. Applying tinted BB
creams, (although not likely to be long-lasting) or just a light natural-looking matte
powder foundation with SPF protection will make your complexion look much fresher than
layers and layers of heavy makeup, and give it a healthy radiance. Before applying primer
or makeup, use an oil-free untinted moisturiser. Then simply use a powder buffing brush to
set the foundation between the brows, around the nose and chin. Beauty blender sponges
work best for applying light layers of sheer foundation and for removing excess makeup.
For a quick revival of your makeup, use a refreshing facial mist to revitalise skin and,
lastly, cosmetic blotting paper to absorb oil and shine. EXPERT TIP: Keep a retractable
lip brush loaded with concealer in your bag for on-the-go touch-ups. Add a little warmth
and a tinge of colour to your skin by using powder bronzer to enhance your features. A
beautiful natural contoured look is incredibly easy to achieve by blending varying shades
over areas of your face. With a blender brush, sweep the bronzer across the forehead from
temple to temple making sure to tap off any excess powder before you begin. Then contour
your cheekbones by sucking in your cheeks and gently blending the powder outwards from the
ear using tiny circular brushstrokes. Continue sweeping the bronzer along the edge of your
jawline, stopping at your chin for a more defined look. Finally, use a smaller brush to
dust the sides and the tip of your nose. Use a highlighter on areas not covered by the
bronzer such as just above and below the eyebrows, under the eyes, the centre of your chin
and above your lips. Always blend blusher up and out along then plumpest area of your
cheek which is the apple, following the contours of your face. A powder blusher will
typically last longer than a cream but keep in mind, the best place to put it depends on
the shape of your face. EXPERT TIP: Sweep a little bronzer over your neck and earlobes for
a perfect sun-kissed look! Beat the heat and redefine your total makeover in minutes when
fixing your peepers. For longer-lasting eyeshadow, smooth on an eye primer before applying
or, for the ultimate staying-power, apply a non-creasing cream shadow under a powder
shadow so it stays put and looks more intensified. Eyeliners should be smudge-proof and a
good brow pencil can transform sad, sparse brows into full, thick, and perfectly-defined
arches. Don't overdo the mascara and make sure it is waterproof. EXPERT TIP: Apply your
regular pencil or eyeliner, then use a small angled brush to press a dark shadow over the
liner to set it for longer wear. From soft matte nude shades to a touch of tinted gloss,going for more sheer or natural-looking colours will be enough to enhance your lips in the
clammy heat. Use a tinted lip balm with SPF before applying other cosmetics. In hot
climates, lipsticks can smear and bleed more easily but an 'invisible' lip liner can stop
this from happening. You can also cover and fill in your lips with a liner before applying
a lipstick/gloss. This will leave you with colourful lips long after your lipstick/gloss
has rubbed off. EXPERT TIP: Always blot your lips with clean tissue paper and re-apply
your lipstick/gloss to increase longevity. Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected: All the

page3_article_18.pdf,"Designer Thilini Silva reveals her love for batik
I’ve always liked fashion and everything relating to it. From watching my mother match her
clothes and accessories when dressing up, to making little clothes for my Barbie dolls. I
have always loved being involved in fashion. Ever since I remember I have always tagged
along with my mother when she used to go fabric shopping. Upon seeing the various fabric,
all these ideas popped into my head and I used to be like the proverbial kid in a candy
store. I also spent a lot of time in my mother’s workshop watching the process of her
creating an outfit from a sketch to the finished product. When I spent time helping her
out I realized this is what I enjoy doing, experimenting, getting my hands dirty, taking a
risk and making mistakes all in pursuit of creating a fashionable garment. I also
considered other careers like architecture and I visited sites and went through my
father’s work. However, it is always fashion design that I wanted to do and that is where
my heart is. I’ve been designing ever since I can remember. First with designing clothes
for my Barbies and then after graduating from The Academy of Design (Northumbria
University) in 2018, I started retailing my designs. Everything about it. I love how you
can build, rebuild and transform fabric into something special. I also love how you can
take a risk with your design and then you realise that you have created something very
innovative and extremely wearable. The chance to experiment and create beauty is endless.
I like that! I have been very blessed to have both my parents support my career choice in
every possible way. They both have invested their time and money into my ambition. From
chipping in with money to buy fabric, spending time over a cup of coffee to critiquing my
designs they have helped me immeasurably. Above all they have given me the freedom to
follow my dreams, even pushing me towards my goals when I take things a bit too easy! I
have named it ‘The Floral Tropics’. It is a resort wear collection for my label T.S.S. I
was inspired by the tropical environment of Sri Lanka. My goals are many. However if I had
to pick, I would say my main goal is to create clothes that would make my clients feel
confident and beautiful and there by make my mark in the fashion world as a designer of
repute. For my graduation I had to present a final collection for which I created a jacket
which made it to the runway at the Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week graduate show. After
spotting the jacket, make-up artist, Nadiya Fernando wore the jacket for a society event.
It was a proud moment to have Nadiya wear a design of mine. On the day Nadiya wore the
jacket, I received a message from PR saying they would be interested in retailing my
creations. I showed them my collection and the rest as they say, is history. It had always
been a little dream of mine to retail at PR. This has also given me an opportunity to dip
my toes in the world of entrepreneurship. Although I’ve been around batik I was never a
fan of it. However, whenever I had free time I would help my mother out in her workshop
and I enjoyed the whole process of creating batik. When I started working on my final
collection for my graduation I had my floral hand paintings ready to create a set of
prints but upon seeing the floral hand paintings the main lecturer suggested that I paint
the fabric instead of printing it. At the time I didn’t want to use silk paint nor fabric
paint because it changes the texture of the fabric, so after consulting my mother she
suggested painting with cold dyes. I started off my sampling and had the most enjoyable
time painting them and using the batik method to get my background colour. I also received
positive feedback on the samples which convinced me to work more with batik. Since then Ihave used batik as my mode of expression. Alexander McQueen, Vera Wang, Christian Dior,
Giorgio Armani and Yohji Yamamoto. I don’t really have a muse but I look up to a few
fashion idols. Yes it does. Most of the fabrics that I use are factory surplus which are
sold via fabric traders. When I am designing I try to create clothes that have minimum
fabric waste. Whatever fabric is left over I give to a small business that collects fabric
wastage. When it comes to dyeing the fabric I use the leftover dyes from painting to make
a new colour by mixing it up. I have been exceptionally lucky to be a designer in an era
where the industry has extended a lot of support to newcomers. From the top to the bottom
of the fashion industry everyone has been very supportive and this has had a very positive
impact on almost all of our young designers. This is where I struggle the most as a young
designer. In the real world I have to deal with costing a garment. The time spent on
sourcing, designing and manufacturing has to be factored into the cost. Having a mother
that’s a designer I take her advice and look up to her when it comes to the commercial
aspect of my business. I am also fortunate that I get some help from the PR team when it
comes to this. I do. I follow the same process we were taught at university, that is to
collect whatever trends, interesting pictures or anything that inspires us and mix it up.
I keep sketching and trying out samples until it looks good. Not really, I am a huge fan
of colour. Having said that, my most recent collections that I have done are in shades of
pink, black and white. I’ve always been a fan of these colours; pink is a colour that’s
feminine, soft, innocent and black seems strong , overpowering and it’s always a safe
colour for anyone and white - my favourite of all. I would say anything looks good in
white! Going forward I will be adding a lot of colour to my future collections. I believe
every designer is different from another. I think it is very important to have your own
identity and give your 100% to your creations. That would help you not only to stand out
from the rest but also to succeed in a competitive industry such as this. I am working on
having a stable brand and looking for opportunities to retail internationally. That is the
plan... watch this space! Photographs : You’re My Favorite, Make-up: Makeup by Thanu,

page3_article_19.pdf,"Rock Your Hair with the Coolest Catwalk Trends!
LONG BRAIDS Whether you're off to the beach or you just want to keep your hair off your
face, you'll be pleased to hear that braids are very much in fashion. They're tighter,
more structured and closer to the nape of the neck. You can even pull braids back, to the
side or have them coiled low at the back to feel fabulous. Get the look: Wash your hair
with a texturising product, such as a dry shampoo and apply a little volumising shampoo
along with it. When plaiting, keep the braid tight, as it will loosen naturally throughout
the day. Finish with hairspray to tame unwanted flyaways. SLEEK & POLISHED Smooth glossy
hair never goes out of fashion so follow the latest catwalk models for a cool look and
stir up some attention with deep partings, top knots, low ponies and half-up, half-down
styles. Get the look: Use a hydrating shampoo and conditioner with a UV filter to get your
hair in tip-top condition. With a hairdryer, straighten locks in sections to get rid of
kinks. Straighten and brush at the same time so it's super sleek, and finish with a hair
oil for added gloss. MICRO FRINGES Stand out from the crowd with eye-catching baby bangs
(short fringes). They're contemporary and flattering for any age and can work with all
hair textures. Adding space between your eyebrows and fringe can help elongate the face
especially if it's round. Get the look: After having the chop, keep your fringe looking
good by applying a protein hair cream sparingly from root to tip. This will create texture
and add movement too. SHORT BOBS A whole range of bobs in varying lengths are as popular
as ever! However, in 2019, it's time to be bold and daring with a dramatic super-short
crop! Whether you have thick or fine hair, you'll create plenty of depth and dimension,
and there are styles galore to choose from. Get the look: Short, stylish and versatile, if
you want to rock a super short bob, you must first consider your hair texture. If your
hair is really thick, ask your stylist to thin it out as much as possible and style with a
centre parting and sleek finish to be different. SPLASH OF COLOUR It comes as no surprise
that warm chocolate brown is one of the most preferred hair colours for women. So, natural
-looking brunette in various shades such as chestnut or russet incorporating dark blonde
is the colour to be seen sporting this year. HAIR ACCESSORIES Not only have they made a
comeback, but hair accessories are a great way to add glamour to your hairstyle, even with
a short crop. Diamanté hair comb pins, sparkly headbands, sophisticated tiaras all add
that extra bling and don't forget to check out hair rings, the new hot trend to make your
hair stand out, and hair coils which are perfect for thin braids and twists. So there you
have it! Say goodbye to last year's locks and shake up your style. Lorraine Cat Copyrights

page3_article_2.pdf,"Control your Curls!
Other than the Sri Lankan weather, curly hair is the next most unpredictable thing to
exist. You either have a great hair day or the absolute worst, there is no in between, and
the latter tends to occur on the most important days. Having curly hair myself, over the
years I have learnt a few tips that might help you out. Since there isn’t much product
available for curly hair here I have resorted to a few simple home remedies as well.
Disclaimer- Note that the result might differ from person to person depending on the type
of curly hair you have and some products may not suit your curls so feel free to pick and
choose or even mix and match the routine that works for you. 1. Don’t brush your
hair……..unless it is wet Brushing curly hair is a cardinal sin as it takes away all your
curls and leaves you with head full of frizzy hair. Instead brush your hair immedia 2.
Style your hair when it’s wet Curls look best right after a bath. So if you need your hair
to sit a certain way make sure it’s after a bath. However if you plan to leave it loose
make sure you have enough time to dry it fully so that it will stay perfectly curly and
you don’t walk out of the house with half wet and half dry hair. 3. Drying your hair For
some people drying curly hair can be a hassle as it takes a long time due to the volume
and curliness as opposed to straight or wavy hair. Additionally as curls tend to be heavy
when wet they may pull your hair down thus giving it a flattened look on top and a
voluminous look at the bottom making it look like hair from the Shakespearean era. Instead
take the front bit of your hair and clip it on the top of your head whilst drying your
hair. This way your hair won’t be flat on the top and it will give it a bit of volume. 4.
Leave-on conditioner or Argan oil This is another great product to use on your curls as it
helps keep your curls in shape even after it is dry and gives it a shiny look. As we live
in a humid country this will also help keep your curls moisturized. A little bit goes a
long way so add a few drops into your hand scrunch it into the bottom half of your hair
instead of dragging it up and down. (Make sure you do this while your hair is wet) 5.
Shampoo and Conditioner Most curly hair requires more conditioner than other types of hair
and less shampoo. This is because curly hair tends to get dry easily. Whilst conditioner
tends to soften your curls it can also cause your hair to become too heavy if too much is
applied so it requires a little trial and error. If you haven’t found the right
conditioner maybe resorting to using Tresemme will help you out. 6. Tying Try not to tie
your hair too tightly as that can flatten your curls, instead try to leave a little
breathing room for your hair. This can be done by not scraping your hair back tightly but
letting it be a little loose in the front and using a hair band that is bigger in size as
opposed to the tiny tight ones or better yet a silk scrunchie as this isn’t so rough on
your hair. This will ensure your hair stays bouncy and curly throughout the day. 7. Make
sure your hairdresser knows how to cut curly hair Another mistake people make with curly
hair is not cutting it properly. Firstly when deciding the length remember that when your
hair is straightened out as it will be much longer so if you cut two inches off when it
curls back again it will be four inches shorter. Therefore ensure that you cut the
absolute bare minimum if you intend on keeping the length and make sure you go to a hair
dresser who understands curly hair. Also remember that the more layers you have the more
voluminous your hair will be so be careful as to where you want the layers to start from
as that can make or break your look. 8. AVC rinse treatment This is where you apply applecider vinegar when having a shower. It can be applied either before shampoo or after
conditioner and there is no special order to it. This will help make your curls bouncier,
shinier and overall give it a healthier look. 9. Don’t oil your hair directly Many people
do resort to oiling hair here but if you have curly hair you might not want to as oil can
retain in your hair longer thus not allowing your hair to breathe and causing it to be
heavy thus making the top of your head flat. If you must apply oil in case your scalp is
dry mix it into the AVC treatment. You can also resort to adding castor oil into the AVC
treatment instead or even just into your shampoo. 10. Pineapple top your hair when
sleeping Sleeping with wet hair is a hotly debated point as for some it dampens their
curls whilst others wake up with perfectly set curls (I belong to the latter category). So
this is another trial and error situation where you need to see what works for you. If you
want you can also pineapple your hair – tie or wrap your damp hair up with a silk scarf or
scrunchie, right on the top of your head, and go to sleep. In the morning just let it
loose and you’re ready to go. There are many videos on YouTube for your reference and
Alicia Keys is often seen wearing her hair like this so make sure you check out her
tutorials too. Hope these tips help you get through the day! She’s an avid Marvel fan, an
old girl of Ladies’ College and now an LLB graduate from the Faculty of Law, Colombo. She
fell in love with writing when she joined her school’s magazine committee by chance and
since then has seized every opportunity she can to pursue writing. Additionally she absolu

page3_article_20.pdf,"In Conversation With Dimuthu Sahabandu
It came as no surprise to see contemporary designer Dimuthu Sahabandu once again on the
catwalk at Colombo's Fashion Week. The talented Sri Lankan designer has helped pave the
way for the growing interest in capsule wardrobes; a collection of essential clothing that
is composed of interchangeable items to maximise the number of outfits that can be
created. Dimuthu's unmistakable ready-to-wear designs are limited and aim to provide women
with an outfit for every occasion. HI! chats to Dimuthu about Colombo's Fashion Week, the
Sri Lankan fashion industry, his sought-after collections and much more: Dimuthu, let's
first start with how it felt to be showcasing your new collection again at Colombo's
Fashion Week. What's changed since you took to the runway here for the first time? A lot
has changed. I think I’ve evolved as a person and also as a designer with experience. The
way I look at fashion in Colombo, my understanding of fashion buyers, retailers and high-
end consumers have all changed over the years. My first show in 2010 was soon after my
graduation from 'La Salle College of the Arts' and I was fresh out of design school. All I
wanted was to create statement pieces. I wasn’t too interested in the wearability of
fashion but I think over time I’ve now learnt to balance wearables and avant-garde,
keeping my passion alive. I think I’ve learnt to be practical as well. What about your own
brand, Dimuthu Sahabandu? How was it established and how have you set it apart from your
competitors? The brand was launched in 2011 at CFW and things officially kick-started
after my first show. I was then able to move into fashion retail with some of Sri Lanka’s
leading designer boutiques. I've also branched out into custom designed evening and bridal
wear which I oversee at my studio with my in-house production team. I've never been too
concerned about competition. I always believe that if you stay true to yourself and your
signature as a brand, you do not have to worry about competitors. I believe in learning to
co-exist with other designers, brands in the same trade; there is enough success to go
around. So, how is working in fashion today in Sri Lanka different from when you started
out? My brand was launched in 2010, and even within the past 9 years, there is a massive
improvement in the Sri Lankan fashion industry. People are more aware of designer brands
designed and manufactured in Sri Lanka and moreover, people are conscious of the
difference between mass manufactured products available in stores and designer products
made in limited quantities. Sri Lankan fashion industry is much stronger than it used to
be ten years ago. The 'Capsule Wardrobe' was coined by Susie Faux, the owner of a London
boutique in the 70s and then later popularised by American designer Donna Karan. What
caught your attention about the idea of a collection of clothing that can be augmented
with seasonal pieces? I’ve always liked the idea of mix and match. I tend to do that quite
often in my retail collection. I think it’s important that we get a chance to re-wear the
clothes we buy, especially the most sophisticated products which the high-end consumer
believes, cannot be re-used. Through a capsule collection of separates you get to mix and
match with other pieces you have in your wardrobe and re-wear it even a few seasons later
with new pieces you add to your wardrobe. I do not apply this theory when I design a
collection for a show but I always make sure to apply it when it comes to planning the
retail version of a runway collection going into boutiques. I guess it’s safe to say that
we have a healthy mix of all kinds when it comes to this. There are few perfectionists who
find it difficult to break away from the ideas they have in mind of a perfect wedding andthere are those who let the professionals they hire, do their job. I think I have been
lucky up to now with brides I’ve worked with. They have all trusted me enough to let me
take full control. Can you The collection is inspired by Sri Lankan artist Mudaliyar
A.C.G.S Amarasekara’s painting - 'Devil Dancers Daughter'. Giving the painting my own
interpretation, the collection shows the journey of a young girl overcoming a demonic
possession fighting against her own inner fears, hoping to see light at the end of her
journey. The collection line-up Have influences from outside Sri Lanka found their way
into your designs? I know in the past, you've mentioned the Greek designer, Mary
Katrantzou as being an inspiration. Can you explain that too? I always study designers who
made it big in the international fashion platforms, designers who aren’t necessarily from
fashion capitals of the world. I think there’s a lot you can learn from such designers
who've built their businesses from ground zero to an international brand. On a more
personal note, how do you want women to feel when wearing your creations? I’d like it if
the pieces I create have the power to elevate somebody’s mood, make them feel more
confident, beautiful and respected. How would you describe your own personal style? I
believe I’m more traditional than modern and I believe that reflects in the work I do as
well. I always prefer timeless over trendy. To find out more about Dimuthu Sahabandu

page3_article_21.pdf,"In A Man’s World
Occupying pole position as sri lanka’s only female designer for menswear, sammani
pathiranagama, the founder of O:LIVE couture charts her successes Would you define
yourself as a designer or a tailor for menswear? I would most certainly define myself as a
menswear designer and a stylist. I am trained in menswear designing, tailoring and
styling. As a designer I create new looks and re-imagine traditional men’s silhouettes,
styles and cuts while constantly updating myself with current trends, whereas a tailor
would stitch an existing design that the client provides. At O:LIVE Couture we do a lot of
planning and follow a specific process to make the final garment. I even go to the extent
of advising my clients on how to style the outfit as I care about the whole look of the
outfit I create. You veer more towards designing for men. Why is this? While there are a
lot of male designers heading women’s wear brands there is hardly any female designers
heading menswear brands. I believe a woman is capable of injecting menswear with much
needed new ideas, while creating fashion forward clothes for confident men. I have always
been a huge fan of the tailored look even when it comes to women’s wear and I love
experimenting on how a man’s physique can be used to create interesting patterns while
doing justice to the traditional mens’ silhouettes. As a female designer I benefit from
knowing what makes a man look good through the eyes of a woman which I think is an added
advantage. What are the challenges you face in being a female fashion designer for men in
Sri Lanka? I think I have been fortunate enough to work with a good clien How competitive
would you say the fashion industry in Sri Lanka is? The Sri Lankan fashion industry has
come a long way since the time I started. We have witnessed a steady increase in the
number of designers. The customers too have become more demanding. In order to succeed,
brands have no choice but to meet the customer’s requests with fresh ideas, innovations
and quality products. I think having a competitive market is a good thing and that keeps
the industry evolving and expanding. Why do you think very few women enter the realm of
fashion design for menswear? Maybe they want to work within their comfort zones or it
could also simply be the fact that they are not interested in menswear and it is not as
fast moving as women’s wear. What are your predictions for menswear in Sri Lanka next
season? In the fashion world there are lots of new developments with regards to menswear.
However in Sri Lanka it is difficult to adopt changes straight away but as a designer I
try to implement those trends to suit the Sri Lankan market. Next season I believe that
pas What are some of the obstacles you overcame to be where you are right now? Sri Lankan
consumers were used to buying off the rack products (retail) and one of my challenges was
to build a clien How difficult is it to source quality fabric for menswear in Sri Lanka?
It was quite difficult to find good material in Sri Lanka those days but now there are
quite a lot of suppliers who bring down good quality material. The problem is that the
options with regards to colours, prints and textures are very limited. All my fabrics for
menswear are imported materials and I do not compromise the quality of materials at any
cost. How should men accessorize themselves? Accessorizing plays a huge role in
transforming an average look into a more dapper look. How you accessorize depends on one’s
personality, outfit and the occasion. I always assist my clients in choosing the right
shoes or the accessories to go with their outfit. When accessorizing, you have to always
pick accessories to complement the outfit. Having a variety of ties in terms of design,colour, theme, texture and even material can spice up a man’s outfit and outlook. What are
the most important points to remember when custom making a new suit? Getting a custom made
or a bespoke suit is an experience. It signifies something owned by exactly one man and
implies that the suit will be based on a paper pattern hand-drawn to the exact
specifications of your body. To achieve this you have to communicate well with the
designer about what your requirement is and most importantly get the designers advice in
choosing the right fabric and cut to achieve the desired look. A bespoke suit should
reflect who you want to be and it has to flatter your figure. Now is not the time to be in
denial about your height, your waist, or any other insecurities. It is the designer’s job
to choose the right cut and style to complement your structure. When going for fitting
sessions you should go in your dress shirt and dress shoes and make sure you Tina Edward

There's more to Helga De Silva Blow Perera, former Dior model and owner of Helga's Folly
(a large idiosyncratic chalet ho Yet, who is Helga De Silva Blow Perera? I took high tea
with Helga in a bizarre room at Helga's Folly surrounded by candelabras, antiques and
numerous artefacts of her life. I found it extremely fascinating that this tall
aristocratic woman hadn't wasted a moment of her life, using every single experience to
fuel her creativity, whether it be through art, design or couture. Here, in an exclusive
with HI!, Helga, chats about fashion, her personal views and attitudes on life in general.
HELGA'S FOLLY Helga, I don't want to touch too much on 'Helga's Folly' as our readers can
visit your site: https://www.helgasfolly.com/ and read the many interesting articles about
it. However, apart from the stunning location overlooking the city of Kandy and the
distinctive and unique décor of Helga's Folly, what else do you think makes it a memorable
and unforgettable place for people who have visited? Well, perhaps because it's different.
I like to juxtapose and absolu There must be hundreds of your most treasured possessions
and heirlooms on display here, in every room, including artwork, photographs and
ornaments. Do you often visit them all to reminisce about bygone days? Not too often, but
occasionally when I'm around the ho I know that you were born here in Sri Lanka, in fact,
in one of the rooms downstairs and you must have so many childhood memories, but are there
any rooms that are special to you? I suppose one of my favourite rooms is the small green,
drawing room on the first floor where I liked to sit and study for school. It feels very
intimate and I'd often glance at the clutter of family photographs when I was troubled by
something. I also think that the magnificent 'Jane Lillian Vance Grotto' next to reception
is very magical as I go in there when I need a quiet moment. It's not unlike a jewel-toned
illuminated manuscript and it introduces our home well. It's overflowing with antiques,
family photographs, mirror fragments and three of Jane’s paintings, including her great
painting of me. There is also a 10 by 15ft mural of a fierce owl- faced Kali protector
entreating us to ‘Help Save The Girl Next Door’. This recalls the tragic story of Vance’s
student Morgan Harrington. The grotto a retreat for reverie and gratitude. A call to
action to art, to advocacy and hope. I LOVE it. FASHION Moving you onto my favourite
subject pretty quickly, because life is too short to wear boring clothes. How would you
define your personal style and do you think it has changed over the years? My personal
style changes according to my moods but it always was and still is big collars, glasses,
and high heels. (Not so much the high heels now after I broke my leg). This according to
my daughter is my style and my signature. Do you take styling and fashion advice from your
famous daughter, Selina Blow who has designed clothes and dressed celebrities such as
Angelica Houston? Well, I love my daughter's clothes, but we both have our own styles. I
believe that whatever one wears, one should make it ones own! On saying that, my mother
had great style too and influenced me with her own love of big collars. As I mentioned
before, I LOVE to mix the pedigrees and make whatever I wear my own. My first modelling
job was with the great couturier Mattli, who also designed my wedding dress first time
around, he told me: “Helga, I know that you will do your own thing with it”! I have never
been a slave to fashion as such, I love it all, but I must MAKE IT MY OWN! I do admit to
having a stunning, long, white, silk evening dress which was a gift from the great Madam
Grey, a good friend of my aunt Marcia De Silva De Vigier, the authoress. It's one of mymost prized possessions. I know that you admire and respect the award-winning Irish haute
couture milliner, Philip Treacy who was discovered by your late daughter-in-law, Isabella
Blow who also brought Sophie Dahl and Alexander McQueen to the public's attention. What is
it that you like about Treacy's collections of hats and handbags? I love Philip because he
pushes the boundaries. I love him for his innovation and because he's whimsical. I
consider him to be an architect of hats. Life MUST have whimsy, to take us beyond the
mundane. Philip does all of that. I sometimes wear one of Philips hats whilst sitting at
the computer or when working from my bed. They immedia Apart from hats, what are the two
items that every woman should have in her wardrobe? SHOES and BAGS! From a very early age,
you were modelling for Worth and Dior. What is your view on the 21st-century modelling
industry, and what is being labelled as the 'Instagram generation'? Sadly, I don't use
Instagram, I'm very much out of all that. I think though that modelling back then wasn't
so much of a big cut-throat business as it is today. My heart goes out to models now as
they have much more stress to deal with. I remember being laid back when I worked in the
fashion industry. As we are both aware, nowadays, there is an increased interest in
remaining stylish once we become older. What advice can you give to women who struggle to
find the right balance between staying fashionable and dressing comfortably? Wear whatever
you feel comfortable and happy in. Sadly too many people think: “What will people say”. My
dictum has always been; your life, like it and just go for it! If it makes you happy, it
does not have to make sense to others. ART & CELEBRITIES When did you first start to live
your life 'in art' and where have you drawn your inspirations over the years? When I
returned permanently to Sri Lanka in 1986, I was going through a divorce and my father
suggested that I express my emotions on the walls here. The first room was black, then
came the gold monkeys, ‘See, Hear AND Speak no Evil’. My inspirations have always come
from life and its experiences. UP CLOSE & IN THE FRAME Helga, can you The warmth of the
people. Of all your many achievements so far, what are you most proud of? My children.
What things in life are still a mystery to you? Life! Finally, who according to you is or
was the best-dressed man in Hollywood? Sadly, I don't keep up with all that now. I live a
very sedentary life, but I do remember thinking as a child that Gregory Peck was rather
dapper! On that note, thank you, Helga, for a wonderful afternoon and interview. It's been
wonderful chatting with you. Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected: All the content on this

page3_article_23.pdf,"Mirror Mirror on the Wall, Who is the Fairest of Them All?
Throughout centuries, women have been in pursuit of fair skin as a result of cultures
placing an idealised value on skin tone. In fact, as far back as the 1400s, Elizabethan
women in England were spreading white lead and vinegar on their faces to achieve the pale
flawless complexions they saw depicted in Renaissance paintings. Unfortuna Influenced by
the common belief passed down through generations that having fair-skin brings success and
more opportunities, women around the world, including Nigeria, India and China are
increasingly using cosmetic products to lighten their skin. Here in Sri Lanka, skin-
lightening products such as creams, pills and even injections designed to slow the
production of melanin make up one of the fastest-growing sectors of the beauty industry
and are available throughout the country. Sri Lankan women of all ages have incorporated
them into their daily skin care routine after being swayed by well-known models and
celebrities endorsing them. The question is, in a country of beautiful, feminine, tanned
women, why should 'fairness' even be considered a blessing in present-day? It's perhaps
easy to explain. After generations of colonial rule, discrimination due to skin colour and
its association with wealth and prosperity continues to this day along with the social
pressure underlying skin bleaching. Although working and married women make up the
majority of consumers, an increasing number of woman in their teens also use products to
lighten their skin tones, admitting that they go to even greater lengths to achieve paler
complexions by avoiding all excess sun exposure and wearing foundation several shades
lighter. Natural skin-lightening creams Despite the countless skin-whitening products on
the market, many Sri Lankan women have stuck with natural home remedies and ingredients
for decades. To avoid harmful effects, they rub raw lemons into their skin and make face
masks from ground Turmeric, an old Indian spice containing curcumin which helps reduce
hyperpigmentation effectively lightening the skin over time. Dangers and side-effects
associated with some 'fairness' products It has to be said that attempting to reduce or
remove melanin from the skin can cause many harmful effects especially as it provides
protection from UV rays. Skin-lightening products can result in thinning of the skin,
irritation and even skin cancer if not used under the guidance of a professional. There
are also various reasons why a woman's skin may be darker than she prefers such as
hormonal imbalance, genetics and pigmentary diseases so in these cases, advice from a skin
specialist is advisable before using any skin-whitening agents. Hydroquinone, which
lightens everything from freckles and acne scars to post-inflammatory marks can lead to
pigment cells being damaged if used long term and makes skin extremely sensitive to
sunlight. Also, Glutathione injections, which are banned in some countries, are not
registered as safe in Sri Lanka as their long-term efficacy and safety have not been
proven scientifically for skin-lightening. Embracing the beauty of all skin shades When
all is said and done, skin colour discrimination or Colourism as it is now called, in any
part of the world must be seen as socially unacceptable just as the conception that dark
skin is any less attractive. Fair skin is not a prerequisite for success or happiness and
everyone should celebrate feeling comfortable in their own skin. Mirror mirror on the
wall, who is the fairest of them all? You are! Skin-lightening products can contain
hydroquinone or mercury, both of which can cause Lorraine Cat Lorraine Cat Copyrights

page3_article_25.pdf,"Fashioning The Sari Dress, Rashmi Varma
Text by Tina Edward Gunawardhana How did your journey into fashion begin? Ever since I can
recall, I have loved clothes! I wanted to study fashion but ended up doing a degree in
political science and art history and from there interior design. After working for an
architect and an interior designer, I slowly got into making and designing clothes around
2001. What inspired you to create the sari dress? Indian garments are often a starting
point for creating something new and I love the sari for its many draping variations. The
sari dress was just a one-time design that merged the sari with western dress to make an
easy to wear garment. I did not think that it would become our most popular design! Did
you have any apprehension if the sari dress would become popular in a nation of
conventional sari wearers? The sari dress is not meant to replace the sari! In fact I
often What is your latest collection called and how would you describe it? Collection 5.
It is an exploration of techniques and textures. Why did you take the bold move of
relocating to India from Canada? The textile and craft traditions of India have always
been of great interest to me so it made sense to move to Delhi in 2012 to start a clothing
line using as much handcraft as I possibly could! Where do you gain your inspiration from?
Everywhere. Life. How did you get into costume designing? While I used to freelance as a
designer, costuming opportunities began to come my way and eventually I made it my focus
for a few years while in Toronto. What sort of fabrics do you prefer to work with? The
majority of my fabrics are natural and handloom - silk and cotton. We do also use mill-
made silks and viscoses, but handloom has been our focus. What motivated you to publish
Sar: The essence of Indian Design? My co-author Swapnaa Tamhane, who I have been friends
with for almost 20 years started discussing a book on Indian design objects about 7 years
ago. We could not find many books exploring Indian design nor had there been any notable
exhibitions, so we decided to make Sar with Phaidon Press. What projects are you currently
working on? I am excited to be working as one of the Craft Curators for The Serendipity
Arts Festival in Goa this December, where I will be exploring functional everyday objects
through the handmade. Are your designs available in Sri Lanka? Yes. They are available at
the PR store in Colombo. Copyrights protected: All the content on this website is

‘COVID-19’ has defini It is, first and foremost, worn to protect the spread of the corona
virus and to prevent ourselves from contracting any infectious germs. Way back before we
started to self-quarantine ourselves, facemasks was an accessory commonly used by
celebrities when going in public or making an entrance with fans surrounding them close
by. It was also frequently clad at airports, especially by K-Pop idols when they had to
catch a flight which ultima On the 24 th of April, American Rapper Eve Jeffers Cooper
posted a picture on her Instagram, donning a black mask and hashtagging her initiative
which was later followed up by some of our favourite sitcom and TV series celebrities -
Mayim Bialik, Matt McGorry and Sophia Bush . This is a cause which was launched by the
Pandemic Action Network ; an advocacy that helps to increase support and resources in
order to ensure countries are better prepared to prevent, detect and respond to pandemic
threats. The goal here was to spread accurate information about the benefits of masking as
this is all about protecting our family, friends and loved ones. It also has its added
advantage of celebrities taking on this trend making their fans to try it at home as well.
Amidst all this corona virus chaos, French Fashion Designer Marine Serre’s Paris Fashion
Week began on the Monday, 24 th of February and this time, it was a little different;
models wore a range of outfits along with matching facemasks. These masks have been
described as “anti-pollution masks” by the 28-year-old and have been show-cased in her
catwalk show to raise awareness and concern about the on-going pandemic. Although arenas
have been closed shut, large companies like the Universal Music Group have thought out-of-
the-box and have created a line of facemasks featuring famous Music Superstars such as
BTS, Justin Bieber,2PAC, QUEEN etc., allowing fans all over the world to connect and use
this opportunity to spread love to their inspirations and Life Icons. Even Megabrands like
Disney have partnered up and produced very innovative masks featuring our all-time
favourite cartoon figures from childhood. We can distinctly witness how “Fashion” meets
“Function” in the Fashion World and how this global trend has travelled to several
different nations within a short span of time. We have seen many facemask ventures opening
up in the past month or two and it is very intriguing to see how an international hype
like Facemask Fashion has made a strong entrance into the Apparel industry impacting all
kinds of designers and manufacturers quite largely. We at HI! Online were able to get in
touch with some local facemask brands in Colombo namely Mr. Maker, Persona Apparel, My
Totes Bag, Wear Confetti and many more! We inquired about the factors that drew them to
start up such a business, the responses and reactions received so far by frequent buyers
and what aspects they’ve explored to fulfil the requirements of the target market when
making facemasks. Here’s what we’ve gathered! “Mr. Maker” is a new start-up owned by Wasim
Marikar Bawa and Shabbir Marikar Bawa who have impeccable training in fabric and garments
for the past 6 years! Wasim had been exploring to expand into customised printed products
for quite some time and ultima We “Persona Apparel” is a brand which is not just about
fashion- “We want to make a mask that people can be comfortable and safe in while looking
really great in them”. Since the facemask trend may not seize anytime soon, Persona has
gone out of their comfort zone to create a fantastic range of plain-coloured and vivid,
different printed designs allowing their buyers to mix and match their masks with their
clothes; “We have approached our designs by putting safety & comfort first rather thanfocusing on fashion because we think that is the main requirement of a mask. Fashion comes
second on our list”. They’ve emphasized on how facemasks are a “more visible accessory”
compared to ties and socks and that it’s a great way to showcase style and uniqueness. “We
also saw a huge gap in the market for masks that actually do a good job when it comes to
filtering” Persona added . We also approached “Wear Confetti” who thought of starting up
something because they had free-time in their hands and the current situation motivated
them to conduct a donation campaign which would do a great deal in helping the needy. They
too have been receiving immensely satisfying feedback from regular buyers and are willing
to improve their products even more in future. Wear Confetti consists of very soft and
stylish face-wear which can be typically worn for outings and dine-outs at fancy
restaurants. “Funky Munky” was founded by Shafraz Shakeer and he told us at Hi! Online
that in the first few days of lockdown, he figured that safety masks would be mandatory in
the foreseeable future and he wanted to come up with an accessory that would be fun and
encourage others to wear it constantly. “We cater to people such as petrolheads, sports
fans, marvel fans, FRIENDS fans and a lot more designs in the pipeline” stated Shafraz.
Funky Munky is also willing to improve their products by inquiring their customers for
potential feedback with an open mind so they can perform better. “Nipunika Fernando Design
” is an already existing brand which moved into facemask fashion abit before pandemic as
accessories for custom avant garde and festival fashion. Nipunika has astoundingly
inputted product differentiation as she complies to requests made by her customers to
design wedding masks for Sarees, hand-painted designs. “My Totes Bag” enlightened us with
some very detailed reasons as to why they joined this fashion trend; “People had to spend
Rs.45-50 for disposable masks which can only be used once. Also, disposable masks are
becoming a pollution hazard as most are discarded after a single use”. After doing a full
background check, they decided a re-usable fabric mask with three layers and a soft ear
loop would be more comfortable and affordable. My Totes Bag’s collections include floral
prints tailored to the ladies, professional masks for the gents, trendy masks for today’s
youth and cute prints for the kids which includes the things they love the most.
Affordability and health and safety are vital factors they pressed upon and they didn’t
fail to mention that their masks are NMRA approved with a safety rating of over 98% BFE
(Bacterial Filtration Efficiency). Having witnessed the comfortability of some of these
super-cool masks, they are, without a doubt, many of the ‘go-to’ mask brands that are
highly recommended to purchase! Not only does it feel comfy but it also make heads turn
sideways when going out in public! So we urge you to go buy a fancy mask because not only
does it protect you from the contagious virus but gives you an opportunity to style your
everyday clothes and to feel confident whenever you’re out and about; it’s all about
expressing yourself! I am an independent solo artist that debuted last October. I write
lyrics, make my own music and collaborate with fresh and talented producers. I focus on
themes such as Mental Health and psychological aspects of people in order to provide a
voice to them and to let them know that we're all in this together and they are not alone.

To all the young girls looking for inspiration to start their own business line, here’s
two sisters who made their dream work and revolutionized the beauty industry in Sri Lanka.
While they have their own things going on, they have been each other’s biggest supporters.
Who wouldn’t want your sister to be your partner in business and in life? Here’s Aniqha’s
outlook on questions we all want answers to. Saarah was 21 and I was 20 years old. We are
on our 7th successful year of running our business together. This time has helped me
evolve as an individual. Its taught me patience and that sometimes not everything goes as
planned, so we must be extremely grateful for the many things we have been blessed with.
We often forget to notice them. In my case, that would be my family and closest friends.
The Pandemic has had a substantial impact on our business, as it has for many businesses
in various industries. There was a feeling of uncertainty and a fear of the unknown that
accompanied it, and that ended up affecting our plans and timelines for the future.
However, we knew we couldn’t navigate our way through this unless we were resolute and
agile. Unless we were willing to adapt, we would be left behind. So, we sat down and
prepared the measures that had to be taken in order to get our business up and running.
Hygiene at our Salons have always been a top priority and we were happy to take the
necessary precautions that had to be taken in order to give our clients the confidence to
return. Saarah and I have an age gap of just a year and four months, so we do have our
differences, but she has always been my partner in both business and in life! As we’ve
gotten older our relationship has grown and matured along with it and I value everything
she’s taught me and all the times she’s been there for me. We’ve learned to listen and
respect each other’s perspectives, and this too has taught me many a lesson. When people
nudge/ poke me to express the importance of something they’re saying. Skin Candy is
essentially one of those services that you don’t know you need until you try it!Many of us
aren’t aware that there are 43 muscles in your face and that these hold tension and
stress. Our service primarily focuses on relaxing them by combining facial massage and
facial yoga techniques into a single service. However, we wanted to enhance this
experience by getting our clients to participate in building their own, natural facial
oils based on their skin type. We share our knowledge on what’s best for the client’s skin
and thereafter, we build a customized oil which will then be utilized in the service,
leaving the customer in a state of bliss I prioritize! I focus on the things most
important to me and when I do so, they all fall into place in the end.Sometimes it does
get overwhelming because I feel like I don’t have enough time in my day to focus on
everything I’d like to do, but this is a part of life. Saarah is kind, hardworking and
creative! She inspires me every day. I know you limited me to three words, but it would be
incomplete if I didn’t say that she is also very genuine. Honestly you wouldn’t realize
the impact it has on your face until you’ve had one. I was so blown away by it I decided
to turn it into a business. LOL. As I said earlier this will relax the muscles on your
face, but an added incentive is that it tones your face over time along with promoting
good blood flow and leaving a healthy glow! An ideal date night would be all about the
food and company, with an episode of Parks and Recreation in the background. Comfort is
key so even an oversized T-shirt and yoga pants coupled with a comfy couch is ideal.
However, the occasional heels and dress is always something I go for if it’s a more formalsetting Do yourself a favor and ditch the razor! You will thank me later. No pun intended.
That would be the biggest tip of all. However, EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE! EXFOLIATE! I don’t
think it would be very accurate of me to say that I really have any fashion influencers
that I’ve drawn inspiration from. I mostly just go by wearing something I’m most
comfortable in. It’s unique because to my knowledge, there is no one else that offers a
concept similar to this. It’s the first of its kind and we are extremely happy to be able
to offer it to our clients! This is probably the hardest question thus far as anyone that
knows me, knows that music is a big part of my life. So, picking out a single song is
almost impossible. I would defini Cooking. AKA being the hostess with the most-est. It
sounds cliché but I genuinely do love receiving flowers. Lilies are my fave. That’s easy,

to always do and be better. Another tip would be to always surround yourself with people

page3_article_5.pdf,"The Skincare Hype
During the recent quarantine period, many of us have begun to direct more attention and
more focus towards one area in particular - our skin. Although I took a liking to makeup,
skincare was never really my priority, mainly because initially, it sounded like a waste
of my time and money. That would explain why I have really bad skin. I should’ve known
better, considering my skin type being acne prone and being oily in general. With us being
bored out of our minds at home, we all decided to give various things a go. Whether it is
working out, cooking and baking, learning an aesthetic and so on - my friends and I
decided to zoom in on all our flaws and come up with solutions to fix it. Now, to clarify
- I am not a skincare specialist; but I have done my research. Some of these were picked
up from the internet, while the others, from local skin care reviewers. Although the
internet is the sacred learning space, learning from the experience of local reviewers who
share similar skin types and deal with the same tropical atmosphere is undoubtably more
beneficial. Some local skincare reviewers that I follow to know more about products and
what might work for me are: @skinbysn @skincare_reviews_sl @skincare_with_jey
@simplyglow.lk One wrong move in skincare, could essentially create chaos. That’s why it’s
crucial to always do your own research and testing in addition to following up on
influencers. On a side note, it’s best to test the product on your hand before
permanenting it into your skincare routine. When you enter the world of skin care, you’ll
realize that there’s more to it than just the infamous skincare threesome: Facewash, toner
and cleanser. There are so many products that could be incorporated into your routine;
it’s surreal. There’s, of course, no hard and fast rule where you have to bust a couple of
hundred bucks on every skincare product that exists. If you’re a amateur like I was a
couple months back, here’s how you decide what to do: Skincare is a controversial topic.
My best product could be your worst and vice versa. There’s really no The indisputable
skincare facts: Now that I’ve guided you with the basics into skincare. Let me enlighten
you with what my skincare routine comprises of. The products I have added into my routine
for the A.M. and P.M. are cost effective and work best for me. They can also be found at
any leading supermarket if you want to give any of the mentioned products a shot. Tea tree
is known for treating acne and fading out acne scars. I have been using this product for
quite sometime and it sure has helped me with keeping my face fresh and soft. A popular
myth that needs to be addressed is that oily skin does not require moisturizer. This is
FALSE. This moisturizer is light weight and it prevents your face from getting greasy or
sticky and due to it being a water based cream, easily absorbs into the skin. The Vitamin
E property in this cream helps keep your skin calm. This sunscreen is SPF 30 and works
wonders on my brown skin. It leaves your skin glowing and doesn’t feel oily or heavy on
the skin. A 3 in 1 formula; Cleanser, Scrub, Pack that is suitable for all skin types. It
helps exfoliate and get rid of dead skin cells, blackheads, excess oil and whatever gunk
on your face. Vitamin C works wonders for your face. It protects the skin from UV damage
and lifts away dark spots. While you can incorporate a good vitamin C serum into your
routine, I use the pulp of homemade orange juice and pack it on my face for about 10-15
minutes. With this, you’ll start to notice the difference after just one use. Apply a
sufficient amount of gel on the affected area and watch how your scars start to fade. The
ingredients of this cream also contribute in preventing pimples and help smoothen out yourskin. Never forget to include your lip care in your routine. Scrub your lips with a lip
scrub before applying the balm for a softer finish. Expensive products don’t always mean
that the products are good. Always keep in mind that all products require a minimum of one
month for results to start showing. Skincare takes a lot of patience and effort. Phasing
in and out of your routine will not help you get the desired results. As Erno Laszlo said,
“Beautiful skin requires commitment, Not a miracle.” Make that your skincare mantra, and
you’re one step closer to flawless skin. Amra is a full time sustainability auditor who

Waxed Colombo, one of the most reputed waxing salons in Colombo, with multiple branches

in sanitation methods. Like most of the treatments at Waxed Colombo, the Paraffin Waxed is

research on the brands, its safety and benefits. Yolande stated, ""The wellbeing of
customers matters a lot, and I travel and research on products. Introducing some new,

There is absolu Ramani Fernando, the owner of Sri Lanka's biggest hair salon chain and a
multi-award-winning hairdresser, knows only too well the impact the COVID-19 pandemic is
having on Sri Lanka and the hairdressing industry in general, from manufacturers, sales
teams and distributors to individual hairdressers and their clients. Here, she gives her
slant on the lock-down and her efforts to return life to 'business as usual' and talks
openly about her outlook on hair, beauty, and fashion. While haircuts, styling, colour
changes, and other beauty services such as manicures and waxing aren’t the most pressing
of all needs during a serious public health crisis, and some may see visiting a hair or
beauty salon as frivolous and indulgent, maintaining personal care and appearances can, in
fact, provide a positive outlet for a troubled community. We live and work in a world
where people judge your value in seconds or less. As I’ve always said, people strive to
look attractive and maintain their appearance because when we look good, we feel good.
Grooming is necessary to feel the best about yourself. A new haircut or a new hairstyle
and you will be surprised to see how much a fabulous makeover can actually change how you
feel. And that reflects on your attitude. Every industry has been impacted by coronavirus
shutdowns, but for hairdressers and other hands-on beauty service providers, it’s been
devastating. As a salon owner, there's a lot of responsibility because you want to keep
your staff and ensure that we could come out of this and be able to get back to a state of
normalcy. Although there was a lot of pressure on me, I tried my best to stay positive.
After many meetings and discussions with the health ministry along with my peers in the
industry here in Sri Lanka, we came around to the decision to reopen with limited
essential services, provided that we adhered to protocols and regulations put in place in
order to ensure the safety of our clients and employees. Each country has to treat the
question of opening up their economies differently, depending on their individual ground
situations in respect of the Coronavirus. However, considering the massive damage
lockdowns bring about in any economy, governments will be keen to open up certain sectors
of their economies as soon as it is feasible and safe. As for the Hair and Beauty Industry
in Sri Lanka, representatives of the industry met with the Health Ministry professionals
and high-ups and, after very meaningful discussions, agreed that the hair and beauty
sector could open up initially, in a restricted way, following the guidelines of the
authorities and expanding their services cautiously. Some allowance is given for services
such as cutting hair, where social distancing cannot be strictly implemented. Innovation
in the hair and beauty industry is always taking place, and this has accelerated during
the lockdowns. While most of these innovations would normally be forgotten with time, if
industry professionals get interested in and work on an idea, it may catch on and prove to
be worthwhile. Of course, with social media very strong on ‘do it yourself’ beauty
tutorials, one cannot rule out some ideas being put to use regularly at home. As I
mentioned in my previous answer, after having implemented the rules and regulations laid
out by the Health Ministry, we decided to provide the following services: As for health
and safety changes in the workplace, a client protocol has been posted on our social media
platforms and at all our salon entrances which state all the precautions a client has to
take before visiting the salon. On arrival the client will be sanitised and has to have
their temperature checked before entering the salon. Clients are accepted on anappointment basis only, and are only admitted once the stylist has sanitised his/her work
station and is ready for the client. The Coronavirus has put us all on the back foot and
our focus now is to bring our businesses to a degree of normalcy. Having our salons opened
is only the first step, and implementing the guidelines strictly is the most important
challenge, so that all clients will feel absolu The future is still unknown and our
thoughts are only of the present and trying to save jobs. We however are very positive
that we will learn our lessons and come out of this a much better society. We are all in
this together. Ramani Fernando - 2 Minutes of Idle Chat Ramani Fernando, thank you and

Sri Lankan women are known for their beautiful silky straight hair but there are many
young girls who struggle with embracing their curls and turn to straighteners to control
what they see as having unmanageable locks. However, with the right haircare system and –
most importantly – the right hair products, every single strand can be brought under
control. Commonly occurring curly hair issues are easier to deal with when you understand
why they happen. Heated appliances and the use of chemicals, for example, will defini
Botanical hair oils that are 100% natural and contain plant extracts carefully chosen with
male, female, and infants’ hair well-being in mind and geared towards a different stage of
our lives, and deliver effective solutions to everyday hair problems. Used together
correctly with the LOC ( leave-in, oil and cream ) method, they will encourage hair
regrowth, thicken and volumise hair, moisturise and soothe an itchy scalp whilst offering
particular benefits to those with coily, tight-textured, damaged and low or high porosity
hair. The LOC method is a powerful hair care technique that combines a water-based
conditioner, a botanical hair oil, and a styling cream to retain moisture. How often
should you do the LOC method on natural hair? Technically, you should be able to use the
LOC method every time you do your regular wash and go. In practice, depending on your
scalp condition, hair type, and your natural hair’s relationship with hair oils, how
frequently you should use the method will vary. As LOC is best performed on wet hair when
your hair has absorbed the most moisture possible, try it after washing your hair and see
what you think of the results. This of course raises another question: how often should
you wash natural hair? The answer depends on your hair type and lifestyle. If you have
naturally curly hair, your hair may be more receptive to more frequent cleansing than if
you have tight-textured hair which often craves more oil. Your hair no longer needs to be

page_11.pdf,"Timeless Fashion Classics
Sri Lanka is renowned for textiles produced on centuries-old handcrafted weaving looms,
and for its batik artwork. This technique of hand-dyeing fabrics that uses wax as a dye
repellent to cover parts of a design has today acquired a distinctive look, with
contemporary designers creating colourful patterns on all manner of handmade garments from
shirts, dresses and skirts to sarees and sarongs. Over past decades, the country's fashion
and textile industry also embraced more than a dash of Western influence, adopting some of
the timeless classic pieces that never go out of style. We may pinpoint the 1970s when Sri
Lankan women were greatly influenced by the 'Cultural Revolution' that had begun after the
Second World War. Social expectations changed significantly, along with the way women
dressed, allowing them to enjoy increased freedom and contribute to the metamorphosis of
traditional attire across the country. However, eager youngsters had been interested in
and influenced by Western fashion long before then! Can you remember some of these
'Timeless Fashion Classics' ? 1950s – 1960s The 1950s is sometimes known as the ‘era of
grace’, as it saw the height of the golden age of Hollywood featuring a plethora of
beautiful pin-ups such as Marilyn Monroe, Sophia Loren, Elizabeth Taylor and Grace Kelly
clad in full skirts and puffed sleeves. Glamour had returned with figure-defining garments
worn by women with hourglass silhouettes, and this continued into the swinging ‘60s. The
model Twiggy and sex symbols like Brigette Bardot served as role models for the 1960s,
while Mary Quant's miniskirts and the Modish shift dress (made glamorous by former First
Lady Jackie Kennedy) were all the rage. Towards the end of the 1960s, along with
miniskirts and short ‘A-line’ skirts, Sri Lankans took to wearing the ‘tunic dress’. This
mid-thigh dress could be made with or without sleeves, which were often bell-shaped or cap
sleeves. The sleeved tunic dress was called the Ruth Tunic and was very popular in Sri
Lanka. 1970s – 1980s In 1972, Ceylon's British colonial name was comple This
revolutionised the way people dressed, as women bought clothes that were traditionally
worn by men, and local women were gradually to be seen wearing trousers in public. The
‘bell-bottom’ was a very popular trouser style among young Sri Lankan women during the
1970s and 1980s, along with the similar 'loon pants' (trousers with very wide flared
legs). Also during the 1970s and ‘80s, young women in Sri Lanka wore shirtdresses and
short kaftan dresses made of chiffon fabrics or checked cotton. Usually worn as a short
top with a full-flared long or short skirt, the dresses were influenced by both Western
and Sri Lankan traditions. Even the traditional Sri Lankan redda-hatte (cloth and jacket)
became increasingly fashionable during this period of great change. By the 1980s, icons
such as Madonna, Joan Collins and Princess Diana were becoming bolder in their style, with
extravagant big shoulders, big earrings and big hair. Blazers in black were a signature of
the ‘80s, promoting unrepentant maximalism. It was to become a new era of 'power
dressing', which would yet again have a dramatic impact on the female wardrobe. Lorraine

page_12.pdf,"Seaweed – A Nutrient-Rich Superfood to Supercharge your Health
Did you know there are 42 countries involved in commercial seaweed activity? Or that no
fewer than 221 seaweed species are used regularly in food, medicine, cosmetic products,
pharmaceuticals, fertilisers and animal feed? In fact, seaweed offers bio-active compounds
that aren't available in land-grown plants. For instance, ‘fucoidan’ (found in various
species of brown algae) has valuable antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. But
before we discover more about how seaweed can be beneficial to your health, let's take a
look at commercial seaweed activity in Sri Lanka. Currently, seaweed is being farmed using
sustainable and eco-friendly cultivating techniques in the northern provinces of Mannar,
Kilinochchi, Nainathivu, and Karainagar , where the two primary species that are farmed
are 'Eucheuma spinosum' and 'Kappaphycus alvarezii' (types of red algae), primarily for
export. Both are important in the production of carrageenan, which has a wide range of
commercial and industrial uses. Seaweed seedling banks can also be found in Mannar,
Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Nilaweli, Kayankerni, Okanda, Tangalle, and Kalpitiya in Puttalam
District. Earlier this year, more than 300 families living in Nedunkerny in the northern
Vavuniya District were given the go-ahead by Fisheries Minister Douglas Devananda to
engage in seaweed collection with the intention of selling it. He also authorised
residents of the Kilinochchi District to earn more money from seaweed harvesting, in order
to improve their standard of living. As seaweed is a common sight along Sri Lanka's
southern shore, this would suggest greater potential for starting seaweed mariculture as
an additional source of income for smaller fishing villages in southern Sri Lanka. What
are some of the health and beauty benefits of seaweed? According to experts, the high
concentrations of iodine, potassium, calcium, iron, magnesium, and polyunsaturated fatty
acids make it a valued addition to our diets, even reducing the risk of type 2 diabetes
and heart disease. Its antioxidants, vitamins and minerals also make it a powerful anti-
aging ingredient that can regenerate and protect the skin. But there's more... Seaweed is:

page_13.pdf,"Chamal Jayaratna - Exclusive Interview with the World-Famous Jewellery Designer
Acknowledged and admired as a lapidarist of unique precision, Chamal Jayaratna is one of
today’s leading designers of jewellery and watches. His refined sense of style and love of
all things exquisite have brought his work to the attention of jewellery lovers around the
globe and won him many honours. Chamal is famously associated with L'Azurde, one of the
largest jewellery organisations in the Middle East, and also Australia’s Brilliyond
Jewellery, specialising in sapphires. Furthermore, this debonair award-winning
entrepreneur is notable for being one of the very first designers in Sri Lanka to use the
advanced computer-aided design (CAD) technique to produce his one-of-a-kind masterpieces.
A true perfectionist who is steeped in modern manufacturing technologies, Chamal joins us
today to talk about jewellery, computer-aided design and the man himself. Let's start with
this: why are women, in particular, so passionate about jewellery? Well, jewellery has an
unquestionable ability to bring out the best in a woman's features and personality when
the right piece is worn by the right individual on the right occasion. It is important for
a woman as it can make her feel beautiful, stylish, special, and confident. Jewellery
ultima So do you believe that wearing jewellery can enhance a woman emotionally,
personally and professionally? Yes, jewellery has the capacity to make a great impact on a
woman’s life – as I mentioned earlier, it allows her to feel elegant and self-assured. An
attractive piece of jewellery can also make the wearer seem strong and positive, enhancing
her self-image both personally and professionally. Therefore, jewellery is an essential
part of a woman’s life. In recent years, we’ve seen gender norms that categorise jewellery
as ‘feminine’ or ‘masculine’ gradually being phased out. Does that influence your
creativity in any way? Such gender norms have played a role in the jewellery industry.
People may see jewellery as something that women wear, and consider it odd when men wear
jewels. Nevertheless, I have designed items that both genders could wear. There are no
rules in the jewellery world. As gender norms became blurred, jewellery has developed as a
form of self-expression so that today it is worn to highlight aspects of the wearer’s
personality. What is important is that, whatever the gender, jewellery should feel cool
and comfortable to wear. The benefits of using 3D CAD prototyping technology in the
jewellery industry are numerous. It all starts with a 2D sketch or idea that is turned
into an intricate and detailed 3D design by software like Rhino, Matrix or Zbrush – CAD
programmes specifically designed for modelling jewellery. The software facilitates the
creation of very detailed pieces of jewellery by combining elements from a large choice of
components, thus allowing us to see photo-realistic images of designed 3D models. The 3D
printer then uses a wax-like resin as a printing material which is used for casting and
turning these 3D models into wax. It saves time and improves quality. Where do your design
concepts come from? Where do you look for creative inspiration? I express myself through
creating jewellery designs inspired by nature and architecture. What are your favourite
materials to use? Mostly precious materials like white, yellow or rose gold and coloured
gems such as sapphires, also enamel and electroplating materials. How do you navigate the
dividing line between being unique and having commercial appeal? It depends... Generally,
I'm working with luxury platforms around a small number of one-off projects. When I
receive an order to design for the commercial market, using mass production techniques, I
have to discipline myself to do the work within a limited time period to meet deliveryschedules. Chamal, you've won numerous awards in world-class events. Just last year you
were awarded the prestigious 'Luster Award' for Foam and Pearls Earrings at the
International Pearl Design Competition USA. With an abundance of choices in the fashion
and jewellery industry, how do you differentiate yourself from your competitors and keep
coming up with these innovative yet marketable concepts? Throughout my journey as a
designer, I've never focused on what others are doing. Every project that I work on I see
as a challenge, and I always try to create something unique which incorporates certain
elements of my brand strategy and brand identity that can really make me stand out from my
competitors. What would you say are the upcoming trends in the jewellery and watch design
industry? While the jewellery and watch sector has to date been considered rather
traditional, by 2025 it should be more brand-oriented, more digital and more sustainable
than ever before, thus initiating a fundamentally new era of fine jewellery. With an
annual growth rate of 8 to 12 per cent, branded jewellery will increase the most – about
three times as quickly as the overall market. The result: an intensification of
competition between established luxury jewellery brands, and new direct-to-consumer
companies to cater for individualised, opinionated customers. What advice would you have
for an aspiring jewellery designer? Don’t compare yourself to other designers. You got
into design to be creative, so let that creativity shine and use it to generate work that
is as individual as you are! Now, what about the man behind the jewellery— Besides being,
smart, stylish, sexy and savvy, who is Chamal Jayaratna? Stylish and creative. So, what’s
your latest wardrobe investment? Hmm, I got the 'Audio AUX Men’s Bracelet' I designed for
a celebrity project with R&B Singer Chris Brown, as a memento. It was a music-inspired
collection for NOVUM. What’s your favourite thing to do? I used to work as a DJ during my
school years and I've actually spent almost 22 years DJing as a hobby, so I guess music
has always been in my blood. I love travelling too... it's the best part of life. What are
you currently working on? I'm currently working with 'Design Gold Australia' on a diamond
jewellery project, and I'm also with Brilliyond, Australia, plus W&W Paris , engaged in a
luxury watch project. Do you have one last thing you'd like to say to our readers? In Sri
Lanka, j ewellery design does not have the same scope as fashion designing. Therefore, my
future aspiration is to start a design institute for talented and aspiring youth who are
passionate about jewellery design and want to gain in-depth knowledge of the industry and
sharpen their skills. Thank you Chamal! That was fabulous. For more information on Chamal

With daytime temperatures in August regularly reaching 30°C in Colombo, accompanied by a
guaranteed six hours of sunshine per day, it’s vitally important that you pay attention to
protecting your skin. According to statistics, Sri Lanka's UV index ranges from 8 to 12

page_15.pdf,"Styling it up to beat the Lankan heat
The weather as of late has been nothing short of extremely hot and unbearable and the
humidity is just making things that much worse. As a result of this, I understand that
dressing up during the day can feel like such a task. Hopefully, with these fashion tips
and tricks (some of which you may know, and some of which you may not!), your fashion game
is going to feel nothing but light and breezy. 1. Breathable materials like cotton and
linen are your best friend. These fabrics cause the least amount of sweating, and you’ll
feel cool throughout the day. That being said, stay away from clothes made out of silk,
polyester and nylon. They are a huge “NO NO” on sunny days. 2. While most of us are drawn
to darker colors when it comes to fashion, pas 3. Looser is cooler. That’s your fashion
mantra on a hot day. Opt for looser fits like flowy dresses, shorts, and skirts that
create a layer of air between your body and the outfit you have on. 4. This goes without
saying but short skirts > pants. However, skirts along can become uncomfortable due to the
friction and heat caused when your legs rub together. Shorts underneath your skirt will
help. On that note, if you must wear pants, ditch the jeans. Denim is such a heavy fabric,
and you can totally do without it in this weather. 5. I speak for everyone when I say
this, but one of our biggest fashion insecurities is sweat lines. Sleeveless tops is your
go-to answer. In the event that you cannot wear sleeveless fits due to work reasons and
what not, buttoned up short sleeves in a cooling material will do the trick 6. Layering
will suffocate you to death. If you are looking to dress modestly, your safest course of
action would be to dress modest clothes such as a maxi dress, or a long sleeve shirt
without having to layer clothing piece over piece. Leave your over coats and inner
t-shirts for those days with a little bit of rain. 7. Sunglasses and Sunscreen. A MUST! 8.
Unless you’re styling a straw hat, which is THE perfect hot weather accessory, leave your
hat at home. Majority of your body heat is lost through the head, and you do not need to
be blocking that gateway. 9. The less the better. Keep your jewelry to a minimum. The
metal against your skin can become hot and frustrate you further. While we are on the
subject of keeping it at a minimum, replace that massive tote bag with a small side bag.
Watch your summer outfit go from 1 to 10 on a cuteness scale. 10. While sneakers can make
an outfit look chic and trendy, open toe sandals can make all the difference in the world.
Get styling. This heat isn’t going anywhere. Amra is a full time sustainability auditor

Digital fashion has arrived with a BANG and boy is it here to stay! From virtual clothes
and footwear to digital handbags and accessories, this new exciting trend of ' wearing '
computer-generated designs (either as video filters or photo overlays) is taking social
media platforms by storm. Not convinced that paying real money for virtual clothes is
kosher? Well, perhaps you should think again! Shopping for that little red dress, the
perfect bag or cool accessories to wear with your ' zoom ' outfit or for its Instagram
debut can be as simple as tapping to select the item required on one of the digital
fashion apps, such as 'XR Couture', 'Dress X', 'The Fabricant' and 'Special Items'. Once
you spot what you want on the site, you just upload a good high-quality full-length photo
of yourself (in JPG or PNG format) and let the app's graphic designers superimpose and
custom-tailor the design onto your figure! This provides you with the opportunity to wear
whatever you want while offering an unconstrained and bizarre way for you to enjoy fashion
whatever your age, gender, or physical build. What's more, as the tech gets more
sophisticated, apps will be able to help consumers try on the 3D garments in virtual
dressing rooms, cutting down on any measurement issues and returns because digital clothes
fit all sizes. 'Eyemagnet', a company providing a place-based digital media and technology
solution to retail and enterprise customers, have already developed the ' Virtual Dressing
Room ' for the 'Hallensteins' menswear chain. The changing room is transformed into a
single panel which reflects the user. These users can then use simple arm and hand
gestures to ‘try on’ any apparel in the shop, take a photo of any selected outfit and have
it sent to their mobile So, how do luxury physical fashion brands see this new
development? Many are enthralled by the possibilities of AR wearables or virtual couture
but are confident that computer-generated imagery will not replace actual clothes or
material purchases any time soon. As for younger tech-savvy shoppers, the idea of using
digital fashion collection tools to utilise imagery across their multitude of metaverse
platforms, games, AR/VR and more is both revolutionary and welcome. Visual representation
of clothing etc. takes us beyond the boundaries of what is ' real ' allowing you to
fabricate digital couture and enjoy sensory online fashion experiences. For this reason,
this creative evolution in the global fashion industry will continue to grow with
consumers also seeing how their makeup looks in real-time and in 3D via virtual cosmetic
counters. Finally, keep the following things in mind for a perfect digital fashion

a great alternative to the sassy go-to crop tops and tank tops you'll see on the streets.
Alongside the trending motifs of shimmery and iridescent tones, the checker prints,

bodysuits-turned-swimsuits and metallic bikinis are also trendsetting. But that's not all!
Take a look at these hot cozzies that will make you feel super cool in your own skin:
Tankini A Tankini is a crop top made of spandex-and-cotton or Lycra-and-nylon paired with
a bikini bottom. Although the top is shorter this year, you’ll find them in various

70s-inspired belted swimsuit makes a comeback. Whether it's a ribbed, striped, printed or
crocheted one-piece, the figure-hugging belt will help accentuate your curves, give
contour and dimension to your figure, and add colour to a plain cozzie. What's more, you
can creatively utilise your own accessories, personalising your swimwear with braided,
canvas or chain belts that will turn your bathing suit into a statement piece. Classic
String Bikini The ' Itsy Bitsy, Teenie Weenie, Yellow Polka Dot Bikini ' is here to stay

ever wanted to look extremely hot and seductive in the sun, the micro-glitter bikini is
for you. Snug-fitting seductive and flirtatious, this bikini will turn heads, dazzle and
maybe even elicit a compliment or two. Fun to wear (with loads of SPF of course), the
micro-glitter bikini is not for the faint-hearted and utilises little in the way of actual
material. It does come in all sizes, though, and is ideal for a hot pool party. Lorraine

One of the less welcome results of Sri Lanka's tropical year-round hot climate is that
your lips can become dry and chapped. This is why we have to take extra precautions with
our ' smackers' , as even the most expensive lipstick will not look beautiful on parched
lips. Here are 4 hush-hush tips to keep lips looking healthy this summer: To combat the
sultry heat and its effects on your lips, you must stay hydrated and drink plenty of
water. Licking them all the time will only make matters worse even though saliva is made
of 99% water. Why? The remaining 1% of your saliva contains digestive enzymes, uric acid,
electrolytes, mucus-forming proteins, and cholesterol that will increase the dryness. This
means that although you lick your lips thinking that you are causing them to absorb water,
you are in fact only reducing the sensation of having dry lips. A lip balm or lip ointment
with SPF 30 or higher can soothe and provide temporary comfort if applied to dry lips
several times each day and before bed. However, you should make sure you use organic
products rather than those that contain chemicals, fragrances, preservatives or
distinctive flavours. Better still, you could make your own lip mask by slapping natural
honey all over your lips and leaving it for 15 minutes before removing it with warm water.
Effective emollients, such as shea butter and moringa powder, will build up a skin barrier
against environmental damage from UV rays and pollution. They will also make your skin
softer and healthier. Although the skin on your lips is sensitive and delicate, you can
still exfoliate them (no more than twice per week) to remove dead skin cells and product
accumulation, and to even out lip tone. Here’s how: use a soft toothbrush or a cotton bud
with a dab of homemade paste made from ground brown sugar, coconut oil and honey, or
chocolate, brown sugar, shea butter and walnut oil. Rub gently over your dry lips in small
circular motions. Rinse with lukewarm water, then apply a hydrating lip balm. Pamper your
lips at least twice a week to keep them soft and supple. For a smooth kissable pout, use
your fingertips to massage them with aloe vera or coconut/almond oil to minimise the
appearance of wrinkles and lines. Using peppermint oil on your lips can help to improve
circulation too, and it has a cooling effect that will help to relieve dry lips. After
massaging, gently pinch your upper lip between your thumb and index finger and go back and
forth a few times. Massaging or kneading your lips may also increase the blood flow giving
the illusion of a fuller pout! To prevent damage to the skin on your lips, you might want
to use a primer before applying lipstick. This will help prevent your lips becoming dry
from the effect of colouring products, whilst also ensuring that the lipstick doesn't
smear. Lip primers can serve to increase the intensity of the shade and make your lipstick
look better and last longer. Keeping all of the above in mind, it makes sense to take care
of your lips because beneath the makeup and behind the smile, ' the curves of your lips
rewrite history'- Oscar Wilde. # emollients Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected: All the

If you already purchased a new pair of trendy, oversized, statement shades recently, way
to go! – because this year's coolest sunglasses trends are here to stay and as they stand
the test of time, you’ll probably be wearing them time after time wherever you go. But
sunglasses aren’t just for the beach. Adding flair and panache to your favourite outfit,
while protecting your eyes from the sun, futuristic wraparound and shield sunglasses with
chunkier chrome frames are still hugely popular right now and there are even more iconic
styles for you to check out that are extremely à la mode too: Dramatically extra-oversized
sunglasses add glamour to almost every ensemble, wherever you're going, at any time of the
year. They have large frames that hide the majority of your face, giving you a secretive
and confident air. They are available in a wide range of contours and designs, from round
to square to flirty cat-eye. You can wear them with outfits that have a minimalist or
maximalist aesthetic, or you can even don them to enhance your own wacky statement
apparel. If you want to unleash your inner athlete or you just appreciate the look of high
intensity, then the ultra sport mode sunglasses are the perfect accessory for you. With
UV-blocking, aerodynamic, and durable qualities, these snazzy sunglasses are built for
performance and protection. Neon colours, reflecting lenses, and angular designs make them
super futuristic so they are ideal to tie together your ultra sport, activewear, and denim
or streetwear look. Due to their edgy appeal and Y2K nostalgia, wraparound shades are
still undeniably trendsetting largely due to their sleek appearance, earthy-hued lenses
and thin 360-degree frames. They hug your face and are available in a range of moody tones
and shapes, including rectangular, oval, and vintage cat-eye vibes. Wear them when you're
dolled up to go out or when you want to dress down with casual or athletic attire. Classic
black aviators with solid rectangular frames and tinted lenses are an ageless and
versatile option that can complement every face shape and a wide variety of styles. Best
in black metal or tortoiseshell, their lengthy, exaggerated, or slightly peaked and subtle
frames and rims will make your appearance more sleek, sensational, and sophisticated with
a sense of 'quiet luxury'. Styled best with anything from colour-coordinated casual to
formal garb – but don't forget to add a voguish hat or scarf. Combining elements of the
past and the present in your sunglasses collection brings a fresh and original approach to
spice up your vintage-inspired outfits (polka dots and florals) and more modern staples
like leather jackets and denim skirts. These designs take a retro approach by
incorporating metal accents, geometric patterns, or gradient effects into classic features
like cat's eye shapes, acetate frames, or polarised lenses. Acetate frames are bright and
versatile because they are made from plastic which may be shaped into a wide range of
tones and colours. Wear them with neutral or monochrome ensembles to add a flash of
colour, or with colourful designs or accessories for a fun mix-and-match style. The high-

Chloé Perera, better known as hair by chloé on her social media platforms, is a TikTok
sensation famous for her bold hair transformations that never cease to please us. Her
posts have us wanting a new hairdo every other day. Here’s Chloe talking to us about her
journey, the industry and tidbits of her life and experience. She’s even snuck in a hair
care tip or two that’s defini 1. What is your inspiration? I think my inspiration comes
from so many different avenues. Initially I was attracted to this industry because my
mother is a hairdresser as well and so I grew up seeing her do it almost every day, so it
just became second nature to me. Also just seeing what international hair stylists do on a
daily basis is so inspiring. The art that they put out there just makes me want to become
better and to learn more and be on par with them. 2. How long have you been in the beauty
industry and where do you see yourself in the industry years down the line? I have been
working in the beauty industry for a little over 6 years now. I defini 3. Can you I
started just out of school by studying at a hair and beauty academy in Sri Lanka and was
later absorbed into the same company and I’ve been there ever since! 4. What would you say
is your biggest take away from your experience so far? My biggest take away from being a
hairdresser is defini 5. In the instance a client requests for something you believe would
not look good on him/her, how do you deal with it? I think the easiest way to change their
mind is to simply suggest something that I think works for them. I never shoot their ideas
down comple 6. What is the biggest hair care mistake you have seen your clients do? The
biggest mistake would defini 7. Three must watch TV Series. Criminal Minds, Ginny &
Georgia and The Woman in the house across the street from the Girl in the Window. 8. What
is one essential hair care tip you can give our Hi! Readers Use a sulfate free shampoo.
This changed everything for me when I started using one. Sulfate is basically detergent
that is way too harsh for your hair. Using it can cause your hair to be unnecessarily dry
and strip your hair color as well making it fade faster. So defini 9. According to your
social media, you experiment with your hair a lot. Is there anything you’ve regretted
doing in terms of hair experimenting? I don’t think I regret doing anything to my hair
because it’s always about me having fun with it and just experimenting and being myself. I
do regret not doing the crazy colors earlier though! 10. Your 5 daily essentials to carry
around. My wallet, my pouch with all my hair tools in it, an extra mask, an extra
scrunchie and hair clips and a lip balm. 11. What would you say your favorite and least
favorite thing is about doing this? My favorite thing about this job is defini 12. I
believe that behind every set back is an opportunity. Have you ever had any setbacks and
if so, what were some of them? I think everyone experiences some sort of setbacks and the
setback I’ve experienced most is people doubting me which causes me to have doubts about
myself. You can be underestimated by clients and coworkers when you’re so young and a
woman in this industry. People want to keep you in this particular box, or they want you
to do well but never better than them and they believe in traditional mindsets. But I
always love the opportunity to prove them wrong and to shatter people's expectations. 13.
Hate on the internet is inevitable. Is that something you have to go through and how do
you deal with it? Thankfully I haven’t dealt with any hatred at all on the internet yet. I
think it is inevitable with success on social media, but I also know that people will say
things about you when you do the right thing and the wrong thing. I think the way I wouldhandle it is to simply remind myself that they’re also human and if it’s not going to
matter in 5 years, I won’t waste 5 minutes thinking about it. 14. Hair by Chloé has become
a personal brand. How would you describe it? Hair by Chloé is defini 15. What would you
say is the most exciting moment/event you’ve experienced since getting into the industry?
It’s really simple but I’m always super excited when I reveal a client’s new hair color.
The look on their face when you can 16. What strategic advice do you have for up and
coming hairstylists? Be patient and work really hard. It might take time but if you’re
focused and you’re doing your best, your clients will find you and they’ll want to stay
for you. Be confident and show your talent off to the world. 17. What does a typical day
in your industry look like? A typical day is showing up to work at 8:30am and cleaning up
my workspace, checking my appointments for the day and getting whatever supplies I need
ready. Once I start to do clients, I try to make time to have snacks in between and reply
to messages and inquiries from clients online. I usually finish work by around 6pm and
then post some of my work online and reply to client inquiries. And then I get ready for
the next day again. 18. A hair look you’ve always wanted to do but couldn’t find the
nerves to do? I’ve always wanted to shave one side of my head! But I know that my hair
regrowth is going to look very odd because I have curly hair so I’m not looking forward to
having to deal with that which is why I haven’t attempted it yet. 19. Lastly, for all of
us who want the infamous Chloé to revamp our look, how do we get in touch to place
appointments? I think the best way to get in touch with me is through my Instagram!

page_21.pdf,"FASHION REVOLUTION WEEK: 18th – 24th APRIL
'Fashion Revolution Week' (FRW) is a seven-day annual campaign that unites the world's
greatest fashion advocacy movement in memory of the tragic 'Rana Plaza' disaster of April
2013. This devastating accident occurred when an 8-storey commercial building in Savar, on
the outskirts of Dhaka, Bangladesh, gave way with 5,000 garment workers inside. On that
day 1,134 workers were killed and more than 2,500 others were maimed, most of them young
women. The disaster highlighted the human cost of a high-volume, low-cost textile industry
where impoverished sweatshop workers are expected to produce vast numbers of garments in
sub-standard working conditions. The precarious structure at Rana Plaza, which housed five
apparel factories producing clothing for major Western brands in the USA, UK, Spain,
Italy, Germany and Denmark, took less than 90 seconds to collapse. Earlier concerns about
the safety of the building had gone unheeded. This preventable tragedy has now become a
symbol of the threat posed by cheap labour and poor working conditions in the global
fashion industry, and the need for sustainable reform. It has also resulted in successful
campaigns run by Fashion Revolution, educating and inspiring the global community to ask
Who Made My Clothes? Who Made My Fabric? and What's In My Clothes? The theme of this
year's Fashion Revolution Week is 'MONEY FASHION POWER'. Its focus is on changing the
lives and livelihoods of those downtrodden employees who work behind the scenes making the
clothing we see in top international shops and on the world's fashion websites. FRW is
also advocating proposals for changes in legislation that will require apparel suppliers
and manufacturers: Most importantly, this year's theme carries the overriding message:
'The Global Fashion Industry Must and Should Value People Over Growth and Profit' ! Nobody
should have to lose their life for fashion. Since Fashion Revolution Week was born,
individuals from all corners of the world have spoken out in support of fashion industry
reform and their voices are making a marked impact on human and environmental
exploitation. There is a growing interest in 'sustainable fashion' and 'sustainable
clothing' as fashion brands are coming round to the idea of conserving precious resources
and regenerating ecosystems. Sri Lanka produces a tremendous amount of clothing for
export, and there is already widespread recognition of the fashion industry’s impact on
important social and environmental concerns. Many of the country's brands and
manufacturers have taken steps to tackle the issue of fair wages for workers, and are
striving for a more ethical and eco-focused enterprise culture. For example, the ‘Kantala’
brand creates a selection of eco-friendly handbags while supporting the local highly-
skilled artisans who make them, and preserving their traditional craftsmanship. ‘Amma
Natural Textiles’ is an all-women team that produces bags, scarves and jewellery using
botanical dyes sourced from plants and food waste, while ‘House of Lonali' re-uses
unwanted fabric to create bespoke clothing and lifestyle accessories. Today there are many
more Sri Lankan brands that encourage consumers to appreciate the people who make our
clothes and seek to ensure that their human rights are respected and protected. Countries
around the world should be encouraged to follow the lead of Fashion Revolution and take
actions that will result in real change. Meanwhile, we as individuals can use our buying
power to influence brands and retailers to support a revitalised fashion industry where
garment workers are properly valued and cared for, along with our planet. To get involved

Everyone loves a little black dress but dashing scarlet screams power! Here are a few of
the most loved red gown moments in cinematic history from Jessica Rabbit to Scarlett
O’Hara and other legends of the big screen. 1.Audrey Hepburn in a furry red number from
the movie Funny Face by Stanley Donan is sleek, minimal yet sultry and of course, worthy
of all attention. The dress paired with white satin opera gloves was pure sophistication
of the 70s. 2.Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman by Garry Marshall dons an oh-so-glam off
shoulder dress with a plunge neckline. It is the perfect shade of red and the ruched body
makes it ever so dreamy and feminine. The best fit for a rag to riches plot. 3.Marylin
Monroe and Jane Russel in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes wears two glittery numbers with a deep
plunge neckline and a thigh slit. These two dresses are all about taking that spotlight
and painting the town, well, red. 4.Cameron Diaz in The Mask by Chuck Russel is one
unforgettable red-dress moment. The bodycon dress is sexy, powerful with a touch of the-
girl-next-door. It is minimal yet was powerful enough to make Diaz the blonde bombshell in
Hollywood. 5. Keira Knightly in Anna Karenine by Joe Wright is a tad extra with all the
layers and the ruffles. The shade of red is deep, keeping it elegant. The dress is regal
and of course, best worn to make a statement. 6. Bérénice Marlohe in Skyfall by Sam Mendes
is sultry, mysterious and a classic power dress. It is intimidating yet the deep plunge
invites a bit of play. 7.Emma Stone in Gangster Squad is a real piece of work. The dress
is asymmetrical and was flattering the shape of her body. It is the perfect fit for her
fiery hair and feisty composure. 8. Nicole Kidman in Moulin Rouge! By Baz Luhrmann stole
the show. She wore a beautiful silk number with a corset bodice and deep-V neckline that
was flattered her figure. The fair skin, bold lip and the cascade of curls against the
gorgeous dress was the highlight of the show. 9.Grace Kelley in Dial M for Murder by
Alfred Hitchcock wore a classic lace red dress with a bustier top and off-shoulder
neckline, an A line skirt and a mid-length sleeve. Kelley is known for her impeccable
sense of fashion on and off screen and this dress is proof of that. 10. Viven Leigh in
Gone with the Wind is another great red dress that won’t be forgotten from the history of
fashion as well as cinema. The actress portrays the character of Scarlett O’Hara and the
choice of fashion in the movie was exceptional. The dress she wears is embroidered with
glass beads. Lihini is a creative writer with a love for all things food, fashion and

page_23.pdf,"To Beard or Not to Beard, that is the Question
Beards are defini Having facial hair has always been considered a symbol of manhood and
maturity. Nowadays sporting a beard can not only give more structure to your face and
accentuate distinctive facial features, but it can make a bold fashion statement too. Men
like Muttiah Muralitharan, Iraj Weerarratne, Brayan Livera, and Chathuranga Kodithuwakku
are all rocking different types of beards, as are many other handsome and sexy men
throughout Sri Lanka. This year beards will be shorter in length, and fashionable guys
will be cultivating a more trimmed, well-groomed look by taming their facial hair. That
means you should think 'beardscaping' and stocking up on luxurious beard balms which are
perfect for keeping a beard looking neat and tidy. Most waxes contain fragrant herbs to
soften and condition the beard and, with daily use, they nourish and hydrate the skin
underneath too. Don't forget that it's largely your facial shape that determines which
style will suit you best. So, for you guys who are thinking of hanging on to your beards,
let's take a look at four of the hottest on-trend styles for 2022: · THE 5 O’CLOCK SHADOW
– a timeless classic, often known as a stubble beard. Designer stubble has become a
mainstay of men's grooming thanks to the likes of Kumar Sangakkara and Dilan Jay. Few guys
actually develop a '5 o'clock shadow' in a single day, as it will take anywhere between
two to five days to reach a perfect stubble length, depending on how dark your facial hair
is. To achieve a precise and accurate chiselled look, trim your neckline. · VERDI – named
after the 19th-century Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi, this legendary rounded three to
four-inch beard has a handlebar moustache that dangles in a loose curl over the top of it.
The 'tash' can be kept short and distinct from the beard and the whole facial hair can
take about four to eight months to develop. · BEARDSTACHE – basically a full moustache
with a little stubble that lasts anywhere from a few days to a few weeks. The beardstache
works well with a Chevron moustache that is shaped downwards and towards the corner of
your mouth. The stubble adds some definition to your jawline and cheek lines, and the
contrast between the full moustache and the stubble looks hot, just like Tharshan
Thiyagarajah. · VAN DYKE – if you can't wait to grow a full beard, this modern pointy
moustache and goatee are a perfect combination! Named after the 17th-century painter who
painted men with this particular style of facial hair, the Van Dyke adds a certain amount
of roguish bad boy to your appearance. It takes patience and dedication to grow the goatee
(a length of about 1 inch long) but can make a round face look much narrower. Hair around
your cheeks is not required for the Van Dyke goatee so you can trim it all the way down to
the skin. Lorraine Cat Copyrights protected: All the content on this website is copyright

which paved the way for an incredible tale that’s bound to wow aspiring designers to
follow their own. A flame passed down from her talented mother, Sithumini’s awe of her
dedication, work ethic and content founded the very pillars of Nils. Mesmerized by the
smile that her mother donned when dabbling in fabrics and her knack for mixing and
matching various colours and prints to produce stunning clothes, Sithumini was drawn to
all which Nils would soon have to offer. Following in her mother’s footsteps, Sithumini
took over Nils with a passion like no other. Striving to create clothes that are unique,
stylish and practical, she herself is responsible for a majority of the stunning designs
that adorne Nils’ showrooms islandwide. Her sheer commitment in every aspect transformed
Nils from yet another retail brand to one of Sri Lanka’s leading ladies' retail clothing

change clothes for every occasion, be it for the office, a dinner or a celebration, and
it’s quite accustomed to due to a lack of better alternatives. Observing this, Sithumini
introduced a simple and astonishing “desk to dinner” concept that swiftly resolved the
dilemma altogether. And that says it all. Staying true to Sithumini’s vision, Nils
empowers every woman to make a statement from the first glance to the last. Strongly
believing that women can be both professional and stylish, the ladies’ office wear does
just that. Emboldening their customers to dress for success, Nils emphasises their
confidence while adhering to their sense of professionalism and appeasing their bold
fashion sense. With the casual wear, sleepwear and slipper line operating on a smaller
scale, Nils coaxes its customers to be comfortable and fashionable beyond compare.
Needless to say, Sithumini’s experience as a shopper shaped Nils to perfection. She
designed Nils clothing with the typical measurements of various Sri Lankan builds,
producing the perfect fit that we crave for. Realizing the struggle that she and many
others face in procuring clothes in smaller or larger sizes, Nils is incredibly
accommodating. Flattering women with elegant clothes that range from XS, all the way to
5XL, she truly leaves no woman behind. Her flair for mixing and matching prints and
visualizing various styles, passed down from her artistic mother, opened up a whole world
of possibilities. Choosing to produce unique designs in limited quantities, Sithumini
decided on a rare path for Nils that massively contributed to its success. It
distinctively focused on the concept that customers dislike owning clothes that were mass
produced, no matter how stylish or trendy, or having to risk wearing the same as someone
else. And so, hand in hand with gifted designers who consistently develop unique prints,
and the fashion forecasts and reports sculpting the blueprints, these would later be
introduced to the market by Nils in various trendy designs that are quite unlike any
other. Sithumini’s recollection of her mother’s hard work which fed and educated her as achild and her being a mother herself, blossomed a soft spot in her heart for all mothers
alike. Understanding the challenges of being a working mom all too well, Sithumini has
gone out of her way to create opportunities since 2020. Fueled by the job losses incurred
by the pandemic and the mothers that reluctantly resigned to stay at home to take care of
their children, Nils made it their mission to extend a helping hand. Promoting
opportunities to work from home moms who have disciplined themselves to work with minimum
supervision, undoubtedly helped them immensely, mentally and financially, during this
difficult time. Despite it being a rocky start, the campaign is a massive success and will
continue for a long time to come. Despite all hardships that came with being a woman, a
fashion designer and an entrepreneur, Sithumini rose above it all. She states that
managing finance was the most challenging task, as it is for any aspiring entrepreneur.
Learning to grow proper controls happens over time and following countless mistakes which,
as Sithumini can attest to, eventually lead to a smoothly running business and all the
free time you need as an entrepreneur to bring new things to the table. With her time
management and task prioritizing skills which have been moulded with experience, Sithumini
now spends a very limited time on the business, which suffices for her to do her best.
Having been in their shoes, Sithumini encourages aspiring designers to give it their all -
it will most certainly be worth it as long as your heart is in it and you have the
willpower to carry it. Although Nils is well on its way to becoming a reputed and
recognized brand, Sithumini wishes fellow retail brands all the success.With the pandemic
negatively impacting various upcoming brands, she extends her support to local designers
who’ve been disheartened and discouraged. Nils however found the pandemic to be an eye
opener which kickstarted several innovative ideas into play that eventually looked into
new and growing target markets, even overseas. Noting that Sri Lanka harbors countless
talented designers with the potential to exceed international standards, Sithumini urges
aspiring artists to locate the possibilities in the setbacks and aim for the stars, and
ultima In Sithumini’s own words; ""Don't stop yourself just because others think that it is
not possible. In your mind, if you think it is possible and you have a plan to reach your
goal, put yourself together and start working on it."" Copyrights protected: All the

Many parents of young children are apprehensive about allowing their little ones to make
their own fashion decisions. They may fear this will result in them picking out outfits
that are inappropriate or comple That being the case, some specialists – including those
at the 'American Academy of Pediatrics' – recommend that parents encourage their children
to dress independently from the age of four upwards. They believe that kids enjoy picking
out what to wear and benefit from exploring their own sense of style. These fashion tots
may still need help with zips and buttons etc but allowing them to express their
individuality, even in small steps, helps with their identity development. Encouraging
creativity in this way does not mean that children need a huge wardrobe of mini fashion
labels. They only require a few essential items that they can mix and match until they
grow out of them. Even parents who are keen to keep up with all the latest fashion trends
should let their tots have a say in what they choose to wear. It's quite natural to
believe you know what is best for your young children in terms of clothing but, if you are
expecting them to follow in your footsteps and become burgeoning fashionistas, you should
offer them at least two outfit suggestions with acceptable results wherever possible,
allowing them to express themselves as they see fit. To help them along the path of
independence, choose sets of clothing that are easy to wear, such as light cotton, and
fabrics that are easy to care for. Introduce them to new and exciting options and give
them the freedom to select and pick out the garments that they like best. Mini fashion

In the realm of self-care, skincare has transcended gender boundaries, and men are
increasingly recognizing the benefits of a consistent skincare routine. A basic skincare
routine not only helps maintain healthy skin but also contributes to overall confidence
and well-being. This article outlines a straightforward and effective skincare regimen
tailored for men, aiming to provide a clear guide for those new to the world of skincare.
Cleansing: The Foundation of a Healthy Routine Cleansing is the cornerstone of any
skincare routine, as it removes dirt, oil, and pollutants that accumulate on the skin's
surface. Men often have larger pores and produce more oil, making proper cleansing crucial
to prevent breakouts and maintain skin health. Choose a gentle cleanser that suits your
skin type – whether oily, dry, or combination. Steps: Exfoliation: Unveil Fresh Skin
Exfoliation removes dead skin cells, unclogs pores, and promotes healthy cell turnover.
However, exfoliating too frequently can lead to irritation, so it's recommended to
exfoliate only 2-3 times a week. Steps: Moisturizing: Hydrate and Protect Moisturizing is
essential to maintain skin hydration and prevent moisture loss. It also helps balance oil
production, even for those with oily skin. Opt for a moisturizer that is oil-free if you
have oily skin or one that is richer if you have dry skin. Steps: Sun Protection: Guard
Against UV Damage UV rays are a primary cause of premature aging and skin damage.
Regardless of your skin tone or the weather, using sunscreen is a non-negotiable step in
your skincare routine. Steps: Optional Steps: Tailoring Your Routine Depending on your
specific skin concerns, you might want to consider incorporating additional steps into
your routine as well. A basic skincare routine for men doesn't have to be complex to be
effective. Consistency is key – by following these simple steps, you can improve your
skin's health, appearance, and overall well-being. As you start adapting to the world of
skin care, don’t forget that step one is to chuck out that tiny washed out soap bar you’ve
been holding on to for centuries. Amra is a full time sustainability auditor who makes

Did you know that the first thing people notice about you are your shoes? So it is only
logical that they look as great as the rest of you. What better way to do that than in
heels? After all Marilyn Monroe did say heels are a women’s best friend! Shoes can make or
break your ensemble of an outfit. Often people choose the wrong pair of heels mainly
because our knowledge is limited to stilettoes or pumps. Heels don’t always have to cause
you a great deal of pain or be exceptionally high. So here’s a mini guide into the world
of heels that will change your fashion game forever. This would include all heels which
are over four inches mainly pumps stilettoes and heeled sandals. They are versatile as
they can be worn to work or even an event. It can even turn a casual outfit of jeans and a
top into evening glam. These are the more comfortable but still equally stylish heels.
These heels evenly distribute your body weight thus taking pressure off the front of your
foot. If you are unsure about wearing standard heels, block heels are the way to go as
they too can take on any outfit. While this trend is seen mostly in weddings it is slowly
becoming a trend seen in evening cocktail events. Having a detailed and customized heels
just adds that panache to your look. It’s always better to get a basic coloured shoe like
black, white or beige with the heel decorated in gold or silver so that it can be paired
with many outfits. While boots are worn less here due to the weather, depending on the
event they are the perfect in- between for our tropical sun and monsoon rain. They are
versatile in that they are suited for jeans, skirts or even shorts. A low heel will keep
it casual while a higher heel will be keep it dressy. These are probably the one of the
more popular heels known to all. Every girl should own at least one pair as it is often
effortlessly chic. A pair of pumps whatever the colour or print (and there are endless
arrays to choose from) will soon end up being your go-to shoe be it work or an outing. You
would have often seen them being worn by Ariana Grande or Lady Gaga. These shoes have an
additional plateau in the top part of the shoe increasing the overall height of the shoe.
While they may take some time to get used to they have a great funky vibe to them. These
are the perfect summer/spring show as they pair well with a sundress and they are the most
comfortable pair heels out of this list. Granted they don’t go with every outfit but are
great for a brunch event or casual outing. These are quite a tiny heel and shaped exactly
like its name. If you are stressed about wearing heels but still want to look add height
these are the ideal heels. They aren’t too high and they still ensure you’re dressed up.

page_7.pdf,"Dress Up a Pair of Versatile Cargo Pants
Cargo pants or paratrooper pants (or combat trousers as they are frequently called) were
inspired in the 1990s by military-inspired fatigues and continue to be a favourite
utilitarian streetwear get-up. From army surplus stores to catwalk shows, combats are
versatile, practical, comfortable and just smart enough to have that go-everywhere
potential. Having shot to the top of everyday ‘go-to's over the years, women of all ages
now consider cargo pants to be a wardrobe essential – whether the ultra-casual or classic
denim variety or posh faux-leather variations for weekend dressing. They are available in
a variety of silhouettes and materials, including slouchy to slim, lightweight Tencel
(widely used in sustainable fashion), wool-blend gabardine and heavier cotton drill. This
season, however, both luxury brands and mass retailers have given the basic style their
own unique spin to create a casual, polished outfit. Dressed up with a pair of elegant
heels, a slinky silk camisole, or a curve-hugging fitted corset or bustier top, along with
a beautifully tailored jacket, these slouchy trousers have truly gone upmarket. New styles
see them becoming looser rather than skinnier, with higher waists, baggy legs, long hems,
and maximum pocket space with tassels and zippers. · If your cargo pants are baggy, adding
an oversized blazer that falls below your waist or a casual-chic top will help bring the
look together and create structure. · Slimmer-leg cargo trousers can look great with an
oversized shirt or a feminine off-the-shoulder chiffon top and a pair of mid-heeled ankle
boots. · Tailored jackets with a high-cut bodysuit will accentuate your natural shape and
help counteract the casual feel of baggy trousers. · Cuff the ankles of your cargos to
create a flattering tapered shape on the lower leg, then slip on a cotton tank top and a
long sleek trench coat with a pair of platform shoes to create a fashionable slim
silhouette. · Pair cargo pants with an eye-catching statement top set off by super-chic
slingbacks – footwear that shows a little skin can help balance proportions. For a more
relaxed weekend vibe, go for a pair of snazzy, low-heeled ankle boots or high-top
trainers. · Curvy women can choose a classic pair of cargos and pair them with a navy or
black jacket or French-tuck white shirt (the back of the shirt hangs loosely with the
front tucked into the waist). Then add a pair of run-around heels. Avoid combats with huge
pockets if you're concerned about adding extra bulk. · Low-waisted cargo pants look
fabulous juxtaposed with bright colourful T-shirts and a pair of stilettos that just peek
out from below the hem of the trousers. For a mega-glam look, accessorise with a snazzy
hat, contrasting handbag, sparkling bangles, funky sunglasses and signature earrings. · To
finish off your elegant ensemble, braid your hair or pull it into a sleek bun. TikTok
hashtag has received more than six million views, illustrating not just how many people
are interested in learning how to style cargo trousers, but also how difficult it can be
to fashion this look. Meanwhile, the fact that designers like Nicola Brognano, Ralph
Lauren, and Versace have all created their own interpretations of the classic style for
their 2023 collections demonstrates that cargo pants are indeed here to stay. Lorraine Cat

page_8.pdf,"Step Out With the Hottest Fluttery Eyelashes
Lashes frame the face and accentuate the eyes so it's no surprise that, in recent years,
lash extensions have risen to the top of the list of aesthetic procedures. What's more,
extensions are individually adhered to your natural lashes (unlike strip lashes) which
makes them much more customised and realistic-looking. This season, however, heavy fake
eyelashes will no longer be as fashionable, while gaining in popularity are shorter,
subtle and more minimalistic lashes that blend in and are entirely natural-looking. Wispy,
natural lashes tend to enhance your natural features, as they provide just the right
amount of volume without drawing attention to the lashes themselves. Single or classic
lashes typically refer to one extension attached to one natural lash. As an alternative, a
lash technician can add a few extension hairs to one natural lash to create a fan lash or
volume lash if you prefer additional volume. They can even add a fan at exactly the spot
where you want more volume, then taper it out with singles to create hybrid lash
extensions. We've already witnessed unique lash mapping this year, where a range of
lengths, curls, and diameters are combined into a single style. Usually such textured
extensions are made specifically for the person who requests a more distinctive and
individualised look. It's a common misconception that once these semi-permanent lashes are
hand-glued on top of your natural lashes – that's it! While it's true that eyelash
extensions require less maintenance than mascara or daily false eyelashes, they still
require regular care which your professional lash technician will explain during
application. It's good to let him or her help you to determine the size and length of your
new lashes, especially the density, curl, and length of your extensions. This is because
your correct choice of lashes will depend on your natural lashes, bone structure and face
shape. Strictly speaking, lash extensions generally last for up to eight weeks before
falling out naturally, similar to your own lashes. The good news is that once they do
begin to come out, you can have your lash technician reapply them so – in theory – you
should be able to extend the life of your extensions almost indefini In days gone by you
would be strongly advised not to allow your eyelashes to get wet, but some modern adhesive
formulations do permit water exposure after 24 hours. Before that, treat your eyelashes
gently and avoid getting any water on them. When drying off, carefully dab the towel
underneath your eyes to absorb any water. As long as you keep your lash line protected,
you should be able to use certain eye creams, though avoid oily products that can seep
down into the lash line. Most importantly, avoid straining, pulling, or rubbing your new
set of eyelashes, and also applying mascara, as this can cause them to become clumpy and
difficult to clean. It can actually lead to friction, and the makeup remover breaking your
extensions. Because the lashes can become tangled while sleeping or showering, brush them
gently with a clean spoolie brush (a small mascara wand-style brush) first thing in the
morning, after you shower, and at the end of the day. As your lashes grow out above the
lash line, the spoolie may become entangled and tug on your lashes, so only use the tip of
it to separate the lashes to avoid pulling any out. To remove eyelashes, simply apply a
small amount of oil (such as castor or vitamin E) to your eyelashes, gently, and let it
soak through the glue overnight. They should come off easily in the morning when you wash
your face. There is no hard evidence to suggest that eyelash extensions have a long-term
impact on the length or health of your natural lashes. There is a very, very small chanceof developing ‘traction alopecia’ where the continual weight of eyelash extensions might
cause your natural lashes to fall out; but by and large, any long-term lash damage is more
likely the result of years of improper application and care, or wearing extensions that
are excessively longer or thicker than your natural lashes. A word of advice – opt for a
salon that uses butyl cyanoacrylate and octyl cyanoacrylate glues instead of formaldehyde,
as the latter is a known eye irritant that can cause redness, irritation, and itchy
swollen eyelids. Don't forget, too, that if you leave it longer between fill-ins, you'll
end up needing to replace more lashes and it will cost more in the long run.

Leather Collection, one of Sri Lanka’s most trusted names in luxury retail for over three
decades, is set to host a designer pop-up on the 31st of October and 1st of November at
its flagship store on Flower Road, Colombo 7. This special two-day event will bring
together three of the region’s most sought-after designers: Kaveri Lalchand of ByKaveri ,
Indu Abbot of NAZAR by Indu , and Charini Suriyage of CHARINI . The showcase will offer
fashion enthusiasts an exclusive opportunity to explore and shop their latest collections
under one roof, just in time for the festive season. Beyond being a shopping event, this
pop-up represents Leather Collection’s ongoing mission to create meaningful connections
between local and regional talent and a discerning audience. It reflects the brand’s
enduring commitment to creativity, craftsmanship, and conscious style; a celebration of
artistry in every form. Kaveri Lalchand, the creative force behind ByKaveri , has
redefined linen with her unique approach to design. Her brand celebrates slow fashion
through garments that are both timeless and tactile, characterised by fluid silhouettes,
intricate detailing, and an earthy elegance that speaks of understated luxury. Rooted in
the philosophy that fashion should feel as beautiful as it looks, Kaveri’s creations
transform pure linen into pieces of wearable art. Each design is crafted with care,
revealing her instinctive understanding of how women wish to look and feel, free,
comfortable, and graceful. Kaveri’s journey in Sri Lanka began with Niloufer Esufally
Anverally in the early 2000s, when her designs first found a home on the island’s fashion
scene. What began as a heartfelt pursuit of beauty and breathability has since grown into
a beloved international label, admired for its effortless elegance and quiet
sophistication. Her signature style, marked by hand-painted blossoms, delicate embroidery,
and soft layering, continues to captivate women across borders. At the upcoming pop-up,
Kaveri will unveil a collection that embodies authenticity and celebrates the quiet
strength of simplicity. It is a collection that reminds us why she remains one of India’s
most admired designers, an artist whose work mirrors not just elegance, but evolution.
Charini Suriyage, the visionary behind CHARINI , is a designer who has long championed
conscious luxury and ethical craftsmanship. Her designs tell stories of authenticity,
emotion, and responsibility, each creation reflecting a deep respect for the environment
and the artisans who bring her vision to life. Known for her graceful drapes, natural
textures, and refined finishes, Charini’s approach to design is rooted in purpose. Every
collection embodies her belief that beauty and responsibility can coexist in harmony. Her
silhouettes are contemporary yet timeless, celebrating the feminine form through comfort
and sophistication. In collaboration with Niloufer, Charini’s latest collection explores
natural cottons and subtle textures, an evolution that blends purity of fabric with modern
design sensibilities. At the pop-up, she will showcase signature and seasonal creations
that highlight her dedication to mindful craftsmanship and elegant minimalism. Charini’s
work is not merely about fashion, it is a movement towards sustainability, reminding
wearers that true luxury lies in consciousness. Each garment she creates serves as a quiet
statement of integrity, artistry, and refined taste. Indu Abbot, founder and designer of
NAZAR by Indu , brings over three decades of experience in artistry and design. Her label
is a tribute to traditional Indian craftsmanship, featuring exquisite techniques such as
aari, gota-patti, and Chikankari embroidery, all reinterpreted through a modern lens.
Indu’s creations effortlessly balance cultural heritage with contemporary style, offering
pieces that are both rooted in tradition and relevant to today’s global woman. Her colour
palettes range from the serenity of white-on-white to bursts of vibrant hues, creating
garments that are versatile, sophisticated, and full of life. What distinguishes NAZAR by
Indu is the designer’s intuitive understanding of form and flow. Each piece is crafted to
enhance confidence and celebrate femininity, blending artisanal mastery with modernelegance. At the Leather Collection pop-up, Indu will present a festive and occasion-wear
collection that celebrates her enduring design philosophy; timeless, graceful, and deeply
connected to craftsmanship. Every stitch, embellishment, and contour reflects her

they are all bound by a shared commitment to craftsmanship and timeless design.”
Niloufer’s relationship with these designers is rooted in friendship and mutual respect.
“Kaveri, Charini, and Indu have been dear friends and long-standing associates of mine,”
she continued. “It gives me great pleasure to reintroduce Kaveri and Indu to Sri Lanka
through this special showcase. Together with Charini, whose contemporary and conscious
approach to fashion we deeply admire, this pop-up represents a beautiful dialogue between
design philosophies; each unique yet connected.” Leather Collection, which has been
synonymous with refined taste and quality since its inception, has always championed
stories of craftsmanship and design integrity. “Leather Collection has always been about
more than just fashion,” Niloufer added. “It’s about telling stories through design and

women, the women who design and the women who wear their creations with confidence.” Set

thesun_article_The_Fast_Fashion_Blame_Game_Us_or_Them.pdf,"The Fast Fashion Blame Game: Us or Them?
Fashion isn’t just about clothes - it’s a personality test you wear. And lately that test
has come with a timer. Everything’s fast now - fast food, fast WiFi, fast replies and of
course fast fashion. One week it’s Barbie-core, the next it’s clean girl, and somewhere in
between we’re all just trying to keep up when really, you’ve already missed three micro
trends and a Zara drop. But as the shelves overflow and the planet pays the price, one
question keeps coming back - who’s really driving this chaos? The brands recreating
thousands of styles a day, or us, the shoppers who can’t stop hitting “buy now”? Shopping
is more than just buying clothes - it’s you getting high. Ever wonder why every swipe,
click, or try-on makes you crave more? That’s your brain’s party trio - dopamine,
serotonin, and oxytocin - giving your mood a serious lift and making you hit ‘buy now’
with a smile. And with fast fashion, the hit is even stronger: low prices make impulse
buys feel like retail therapy… without the therapy bills. But just like any high has a
crash, that instant rush comes with a downside. It’s called cognitive dissonance - the
discomfort you feel when your actions and beliefs don’t align. In short, it’s basically
guilt-tripping, showing up when you realise the true cost behind that ‘bargain’ buy. To
dodge that guilt, shoppers cook up all kinds of excuses - focusing on the savings,
downplaying the harm, or just conveniently forgetting the mess it causes. So, turns out,
your shopping spree might feel amazing in the moment… but your conscience isn’t always on
board. Brands know exactly how to play with our brains, and they’re totally manipulating
us, from peer pressuring us to creating FOMO, so that we shop more to not feel left out.
Throw in influencer collaborations, celebrity endorsements, flash sales and countdown
timers, and suddenly every scroll feels like an invitation to buy. At the same time, it’s
not just manipulation - it’s adaptation. Fast-fashion brands are lightning quick at
spotting cultural cues, from celebrity outfits and looks from movies to trends like
Barbiecore, Brat Summer, and the Y2K revival. Instead of using their own brain power to
invent trends, they take the shortcut by copying what consumers already crave, producing
cheap, fast versions that are accessible. And it works, which goes to show that brands
shape desire while cashing in on trends that we’ve helped make viral. From weddings to
Halloween, your outfit isn’t just fashion - it’s a social scoreboard, and there is an
unspoken dress code for every occasion. And to be fair, it’s not exactly a tragedy - no
one’s exactly rocking bikinis to weddings. But here’s the real unspoken rule: new outfit,
every time. So, last year’s concert outfit? Totally off-limits this year. Every event
demands something fresh, and dropping big bucks on a new outfit each time isn’t realistic
- enter fast fashion to the rescue. Not every social event, though, is about “new fit, who
this?” Take anti-fast fashion campaigns, celebrities, royals or even the government of
France, which is planning fines of up to €10 per piece on ultra-fast fashion and banning
their ads by 2030. So it turns out, social pressure isn’t always toxic, and not all trends
tell you to shop - some tell you to stop. Eco-friendly vibes… or just smoke and mirrors?
Some brands greenwash while flooding your feed with new drops - a popular tactic to make
us think they’re protecting the environment while really raking in profits. At the same
time, some genuinely seem to care, like Patagonia, Reformation, Mango, Nike, and Adidas,
showcasing transparency, ethically sourced materials, and recycling programs. Sure, some
claims might still be a stretch, but many are verified by third-party sites or backed by
genuine sustainable partnerships. Eco or ego? That’s the question every scroll leaves you
with. Why buy one $30 T-shirt when Shein sells ten for the same price? One of the biggest
reasons we turn to fast fashion is how cheap it is. Why bother with other brands when fast
fashion offers decent quality, endless styles, and instant accessibility - especially
since repeating outfits is basically a no-go for Gen Z? With limited budgets but a desire
to stay trendy, price is king. Sure, many of us would pay for premium sustainable optionsif we could, but here’s the paradox: we want affordability… even when we can actually
afford more. Believe it or not, Gen Z - the biggest target market for fast fashion - is
the wealthiest generation, with global spending power expected to hit a whopping USD 12
trillion by 2030. That’s a lot of clothes, food, houses, cars, and luxury items. Still,
with growing wallets and conscience-aware choices, shoppers can decide whether cheap wins
or mindful fashion rules. Dollar signs or designer vibes? Fast-fashion brands are always
juggling the price game. To satisfy our bargain cravings, they undercut wherever possible,
and that often means dodgy shortcuts: synthetic fibres, toxic dyes, and overworked staff
pulling crazy hours for tiny pay checks. All in the name of staying trendy and in the
game. However, some fast-fashion brands are rolling in cash with prices that aren’t
exactly bargain-bin cheap, yet they still cut costs wherever they can - Mango, H&M, Zara,
and Victoria’s Secret, just plain stingy. From bargain steals to luxe treats, these brands
prove fashion isn’t just about style - it’s a price-fuelled game of ethics too. So, who’s
really driving the fast-fashion frenzy - us, scrolling and splurging, or the brands
tempting us at every click? Technically, the brands are the ones harming the environment…
but spoiler: it’s really us, the consumers. Price drives what we buy, and to stay
competitive, brands often trade sustainability for lower costs - fuelling the fast-fashion
machine. And yes, while both brands and consumers share the blame, at the end of the day,
it comes down to us, because our choices - what we want and what we buy - set the rules
for how brands play the game. So go ahead and shop… just don’t forget who’s really calling
the shots. Hint: it’s you. Enjoy your guilt trip.",6170
thesun_What_the_Worlds_Talking_About_Fashion_Thats_Finally_Growing.pdf,"What the World’s Talking About: Fashion That’s Finally Growing Up
Fashion weeks are often slammed as hotbeds of excess, yet some of the most visible
designers are using that very stage to show something different This week the fashion
world handed us a neat little exam: are we going to treat clothes like magic disposable
things, or like the small, expensive decisions they actually are? From Paris runways to
new industry clubs in Europe, the headlines are all nudging the same idea, less waste,
more care. For those of us in Sri Lanka who love fabric, craft and story, these changes
are both a nudge and an invitation. Let’s warm up with the big picture. Europe, which
generates mountains of discarded textile, has just seen a new player step onto the field:
a coalition of industry groups trying to tackle textile waste properly. The group wants to
build local textile-to-textile recycling hubs, scaling up ways to turn old garments back
into new ones instead of letting them rot or be downcycled into cheap rags. That matters
because right now only a tiny fraction of textile waste in Europe actually becomes new
clothing again, and the coalition says that regional solutions (small, connected recycling
centers) are one of the only realistic ways to change that. In short: clothes need a
second life system, not just a landfill. Next: denim. Jeans are a wardrobe staple
everywhere, and a surprisingly heavy environmental offender. This week the Financial Times
ran a friendly guide to the brands trying to make greener jeans , companies that use
regenerative cotton, recycled fibers, water-saving dyeing processes and even repair
services to keep jeans in circulation longer. The clever bit here is not just swapping
materials but slowing the whole “buy, wear, throw” machine. If your favorite pair of jeans
lasts longer (and can be mended), the planet breathes easier. Now, if you’ve noticed your
favorite brands suddenly sounding like thrift-store activists, you’re not imagining
things. A wave of labels, from sneakers to dresses, are moving beyond eco-friendly fabric
labels and into circular business models: take-back programmes, repair workshops, resale
platforms and rental services. From big names to smaller labels, the message is: “We’ll
help you keep what you buy in use.” These services make sustainable shopping practical: if
a brand offers to repair your shoes or accepts them back for resale, you feel safer buying
a piece in the first place, and the piece gets a new life afterward. And the runways?
Fashion weeks are often slammed as hotbeds of excess, yet some of the most visible
designers are using that very stage to show something different. Stella McCartney, often
called fashion’s eco-conscience, presented a collection that she described as almost
entirely sustainable and completely cruelty-free, and the show was framed as a manifesto
about humanity and the planet. That’s not just feel-good PR; when an influential designer
pushes materials innovation (plant-based alternatives, upcycled denim, pollutant-absorbing
textiles), it nudges suppliers and other brands to follow. Meanwhile, fashion weeks are
shifting geographically, too. Riyadh Fashion Week announced headline shows from designers
like Vivienne Westwood and Stella McCartney, a sign that sustainability conversations are
moving into new markets and that ideas about eco-fashion aren’t just European curiosities
anymore. Global attention can help lift up local makers, if we make sure cultural exchange
includes sustainable production, fair pay, and respect for craftsmanship. So, what does
all this mean for Sri Lanka, a country with a deep handloom history, a booming ready-made
garment industry, and a community of artisans who make beautiful things by hand? First,
the good news: these global shifts create openings for us. Brands and buyers looking for
recycled fibers, hand-finished pieces, and transparent supply lines are precisely the kind
of partners Sri Lankan designers and weavers can work with. If international companies set
up regional recycling hubs, Sri Lanka could explore partnerships for collecting and
regenerating textile waste; an opportunity to create jobs while protecting craft. The key
will be to ensure those jobs are dignified and the benefits reach the artisans, not only
the middlemen. Second, the practical at-home moves people can make are delightfullysimple. Repair instead of replacing. Rent for a single-use occasion. Buy from makers who
offer take-back or repair guarantees. These small choices are exactly what those
“circular” brands are asking customers to do, and when many of us do the same, it changes
demand. Third, designers and small brands in Sri Lanka should treat these trends as design
constraints rather than limits. Constraints breed creativity: designing for repair, using
deadstock and leftover handloom, offering modular pieces that can be updated season after
season, these are not sacrifices of style, they can be the starting point for identity.
Your customer will love a story that goes beyond “pretty” to “purposeful.” Think of a
sari-inspired jacket made from deadstock silk, it’s chic, it’s local, and it carries a
story about value and craft. There are a few caveats. Big sustainability claims need
checking. When a brand says “green” it’s worth asking what that really means, is the
fabric recycled, is the worker paid fairly, does the company take responsibility for its
end-of-life waste? The new European rules (Extended Producer Responsibility) are meant to
force those questions to the surface, and companies worldwide will be watching to see how
these rules actually shape practice. Consumers and journalists, yes, that’s us, should
keep asking the awkward questions. And while it’s lovely when celebrities or big labels
talk sustainability, local systems matter most. We need infrastructure for collection,
repair, and recycling, not just good intentions. That’s where governments, industry
bodies, and civil society can step in with policy and funding to support community-scale
solutions. What can readers do tomorrow? A short checklist: Mend a favourite garment, find
a local tailor and make that pair of trousers last another year. Look for rental or resale
options for special occasions. Ask your favourite store: do you repair? Do you accept
returns for resale? If you sew or mend, teach a neighbour a basic stitch; skills spread
faster than vinyl ads. 5.Support local artisans who use slow, high-quality processes; it
keeps craft alive. Fashion’s latest headlines feel less like a lecture and more like a
friendly invitation. The industry is nudging toward repair tables and take-back bins,
designers are experimenting with plant-based and upcycled materials, and even big shows
are carrying an eco-message. For Sri Lanka, with our centuries old craft legacies and
growing design talent, that’s an opportunity to step into conversations as makers, not
just consumers. If global fashion wants stories and solutions, we have both; and perhaps a
few beautiful, mended jeans to prove we care.",7063
weekendfashionista_article_1_.pdf,"It’s Fall and with the strange weather we’ve been having here in Ottawa it’s been hard to
keep up with what to wear every day. I came across this Burberry inspired duster from Suzy
Shier that is just perfect for Fall weekends. I recently wore it on a trip to Gatineau
Park to see the beautiful autumn leaves as they change colour. It was I love the camel
colour of the exterior and the Burberry inspired print on the interior. There’s also a
hood at the back if you’re feeling extra chilly. You can choose to dress this sweater down
by pairing it with jeans and a tank top like I did or opt for a more formal look and pair
it with coated jeggings or black pants. The best part is it’s a fraction of the price of
an actual Burberry piece. Sometimes it’s nice just to be inspired",777

weather in mind and just had to share one of my fave pieces for Spring 2018! I picked up
this bright and colourful beaded boho bag at a market in Dubai and I think it’s just
perfect for Spring and Summer. If you’re new to my blog you can read all I’ve noticed that
the boho chic trend is totally in this Spring and this bag fits the bill perfectly. I love
how the bright beading adds a pop of colour to my outfit. The bag comes with a removable
strap which allows for it to be worn as a shoulder bag, a cross body or a clutch. I opted
for a more casual weekend look and paired the bag with white jeans and a soft sage
coloured t-shirt. I liked the bold colours int he bag and I wanted to reflect that in my
jewelry so I added a pair of purple beaded earrings which I picked up at H&M . Not only
are these earring so in right now but the beading in the earrings goes perfectly with the
beading on the bag. As I mentioned earlier I picked up this bag at the Old Souk in Dubai.
I had to negotiate the price a bit but it cost be around $30 CAD which I thought was a
steal! If you’re a fan of beaded bags too I’ve added links to some similar pieces below",1237

shoulder top . Stripes are defini I like the menswear and work wear inspired look of this
top. It almost looks like a work blouse with the pinstripe pattern and pronounced cuffs.
The pearl buttons give the top a feminine flair. This top is cotton so it’s very
comfortable and easy to wear. It sits loosely on the body for a relaxed fit. For a relaxed
weekend look I paired this blouse with some white jean capris, a pair of kitten heel sling
backs and a bamboo bag. If you loved the Ark bag from Cult Gaia you’ll love this box bag
from Malibu Skye . I think this outfit is great for running errands, grabbing a coffee
with friends, going out to brunch or just people watching and enjoying the warmer weather.
Most people like to dress down on the weekend but dressed down doesn’t mean badly dressed

of puns . . . let’s twist again with this cute and comfy front twist top from Suzy Shier.
Knotted or front twist tops have been a major trend this Spring and Summer so I was
thrilled to find this top in store. I like the casual look and feel of this top. It’s made
from a rayon blend fabric and super comfortable to wear. I wore it out this past Saturday
as I thought it was perfect for a relaxed weekend look. I paired the top with some cropped
white jeans that I had picked up last year and some mules that I saw in store at Suzy
Shier. The mules give this outfit a bit of an edgy look and these shoes just happen to be
a great dupe of some Steve Madden flats, for a fraction of the price ofcourse To

when you’re wearing yellow right? I was thrilled to find this cute and comfy off the
shoulder yellow gingham print dress at Old Navy . This dress has a fun and feminine feel
to it with the off the shoulder ruffled top and the lace detailing at the bottom. I love
the yellow gingham print, it’s just perfect for a Summer weekend or BBQ. The dress is made
out of a linen and rayon blend fabric so it’s light and fits loosely on the body. I chose
to style this dress as part of a casual outfit and I was so pleased to find this adorable
pineapple straw clutch at Old Navy as well. Straw bags , pom poms and tropical accents are
trending this Summer and this bag combines them all! To complete this outfit I added a
pair of white wedges and some white beaded earrings. My goal in putting this outfit
together was to pick up on the colours in the dress. The clutch picks up on the yellow and

cool and stylish at the same time. I found this chic and comfy floral print maxi at
Forever 21 when I was shopping for my trip to Sri Lanka last month. I’ve been gravitating
towards maxi dresses a lot this Summer. I find they have an element of formality with the
added length and they’re comfortable to wear. I like the contrast of the tropical floral
pattern against the dark background of this particular dress. The weather in Colombo is a
bit cooler than what we experienced last week but the humidity is This maxi is so
comfortable and sits well on the body when worn. I was a bit apprehensive in picking it up
when I saw it on the rack but I’m glad I did. If you’ve ever owned a piece that looks
better on you than it does on the hanger, well this dress is one of those pieces. It has a
zip that fastens on the side and adjustable straps so you can have the neckline to your
liking. I paired the dress with some bright coloured tassel earrings from Forever 21 . I
also found another pair of bauble drop earrings that would go well with the dress. The
dress does run a little longer than other maxis I’ve tried on so I opted for a pair of
block heel sandals. What do you think",1450
